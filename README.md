# bigbrownbeaver

The DGC Arcade machine.  We named the box "bigbrownbeaver" which is why
this repository is named as such.  Here you will find our config backups
and other useful files so just in case there is a problem, we can rebuild
quickly.

These files are from an x86_64 Arch Linux installation but should apply properly to other linux-based installations
