		<name>A Bug's Life</name>
		<desc>Pixar's second animated feature, A Bug's Life, arrived in movie theatres in 1998, and the videogame adaptation was released on the Nintendo GameBoy Color and the Sony Playstation.

It wasn't supposed to appear on the Genesis at all -- Sega's 16-bit system was well past its commercial prime by the late 1990's, even on the hand-me-down/bedroom system basis that tends to keep a trickle of kids' titles coming late in a console's life.  And it never did in any legal form.  But enterprising Asian game pirates saw an opportunity to cash in on Sega and Disney in one go, and thus this wholly unlicensed conversion of the GameBoy Color version of A Bug's Life appeared on the Genesis:</desc>

		<desc>Aero Blasters: Trouble Specialty Raid Unit is a 1990 horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Kaneko and licensed to Namco. The game was originally released in the arcades in 1990 and was subsequently released for the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 (as Aero Blasters) and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (as Air Buster in North America) in 1990 and 1991 respectively.

In Air Buster, the player controls a fighter jet also designed for space travel and shoots enemies, collects power-ups, and defeats bosses to advance levels. As a console game, Air Buster had the distinction of being two player simultaneous, which was rare among side scrolling shooters on home consoles at the time; all games in the Thunder Force, Gradius, and R-Type series were only 1 player on the home consoles.</desc>

		<name>After Burner II</name>
		<desc>Similar to its predecessor, the premise of After Burner II is to get on the F-14 Tomcat and fly mission after mission of shooting planes out of the sky. At your disposal is a vulcan cannon (basically a machine gun) and a limited number of missiles. In some versions of the game the guns fire automatically all the time. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. You also can speed up and slow down to deal with enemies which appear behind you.</desc>

		<desc>This video game is a combat flight simulator similar to After Burner, except the game is played in a first-person view (from inside the cockpit). Gameplay involves flying the fictional F-119D Stealth Fighter against the enemy forces. A terrorist organization stationed out of the Middle East is waging a constant battle against U.S. forces; backed by several hostile governments including the Soviet Union (Although the back of the US package says that the terrorists are backed by extraterrestrial beings). Players must use their stealth abilities in order to evade detection and create a global free society out of a world tormented by the oppressive anti-American regimes.

Boss fights are similar to those found in arcade combat flight simulator games. The score in the game is tabulated in a similar style to similar games found in video arcades. Missions can take place either during the day or during the night.</desc>

		<desc>A game endorsed by the American player who stunned the tennis world in the early 90s with his "Image is everything" looks, sporting long hair, earrings and colorful shirts, Andre Agassi Tennis includes eight players (male and female and as as expected, only Agassi is a real player) rated according to movement speed and both accuracy and strength on serve, backhand and forehand.

Gameplay features all the usual moves: smashes, passing shots, volleys and all kinds of backhand and forehand plays, but unlike other games, precise positioning and timing are crucial to avoid hitting the ball outside the court, swinging the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let the ball hit you on the head.
Three courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor (Sega versions  add a fourth, Hard), but the differences between them are minimal. Game modes change according to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a "Skins" game, where each point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.</desc>

The SNES and Mega Drive/Genesis version were released in 1994, and the Game Boy version in 1995.</desc>

		<name>Another World</name>
		<desc>Another World is a platform game, where the player uses the keyboard or gamepad to make the protagonist Lester run, jump, attack or perform other actions. In the initial part of the game, Lester is weaponless, able to kick at small creatures but otherwise vulnerable. After escaping with his alien ally, Lester acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a standard fire mode, the abilities to create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls. Later, Lester also gains a plasma ball that can be used like a grenade to defeat foes. Enemies will also have the same capabilities, requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome hostile forces and escape.
 
Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and the game will be over if either takes a hit. However, the game uses numerous checkpoints, and the player can restart at the last point indefinitely. On older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later.</desc>

At most spaces there is a building where you are asked five questions. If you get a certain number correct, you can stay at the spot you were in; otherwise you go back to the previous position. Play continues with the next player.
The fourth game mode has various minigames (TODO describe).

There, they will battle the Dark Lords of Castomira, and ultimately confront the Dark Sorceress. These warriors have pledged their lives to the troubled king of Arcus to recapture the mighty Sword of Light, which Castomira has stolen - the weapon used by Princess Leaty to defeat Castomira a thousand years before this night. They are Jedda the swordsman, Erin the warrior-maiden, Diana the archer, and Bead the magic stick-fighter. To defeat the enemy, the warriors will call upon their individual magic powers: Jedda will wield his fire magic; Erin will harness the power of the wind; Diana will use her healing rays of light; and Bead will mimic the magic of the dark lords. They must not falter in their quest, or the diabolical Castomira will assume absolute power, and darkness will reign... forever.</desc>

		<desc>Arrow Flash is a side-scrolling space shooter. The player controls a female spaceship pilot who is sent on a mission into deep space to save the Earth from an assault by an evil dragon from another galaxy. Moving vertically or horizontally, players must avoid or kill the enemies and make it to the end of the level alive where a boss battle awaits. During gameplay, the player can switch at any time between two modes: normal spaceship and flying robot. The two forms use different weapons and also have different special abilities, called Arrow Flash. While the spaceship can fire destructive lasers for major damage, the robot can raise a shield that will protect from enemy attacks for some time and instantly kill anything that touches it. The Arrow Flash attacks can be charged by holding a button for several seconds, or collect icons during your flight to release it quickly afterwards.</desc>

		<desc>Yuri Sakazaki has been kidnapped! Her big brother Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia, his best friend, go search for her on the streets of South Town. As they go deeper and deeper they will find clues as to who ordered the kidnapping, the Sakazaki family's relation to the mob, and a person from their past.

This fighting game is a coin-op conversion of the Neo-Geo hit of the same name, and has all characters, stages, and moves featured in the arcade unit. Unlike the original arcade version, players can now play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate.

The gameplay differs from most fighting games. In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.</desc>

		<desc>In part three of the Streets of Rage series, Mr. X is back and this time his plan involves replacing public officials with his own robots. Only Axel, Blaze, Skate, and new-comer Dr. Zan can stop him. Streets of Rage 3 features all of the beat 'em up action you would expect from a Streets of Rage game. One new feature is the special move power bar, where it only costs energy to do a special move if the bar isn't full. Also new is the ability to do special maneuvers with different weapons, depending on the character. For example, Skate has no special move with the pipe, but does have one with the knife. The opposite is true for Axel. Any weapon Dr. Zan picks up is turned into energy balls which he can throw at the enemies. Secret characters and multiple endings add replay value.</desc>

Meanwhile, on board the spaceship Vulture, Professor T. Bird and the trio of Battletoads - Rash, Zitz and Pimple - are escorting the Princess Angelica back to her home planet, where her father, the Terran Emperor, awaits her safe arrival.

His only reminder of the incident is S.O.P.H.I.A., the vehicle he used to stop them, which he has hidden in an abandoned barn. One day, one bolt of lightning struck the house and caused the ceiling to crumble, knocking Jason unconscious. When Jason woke up, S.O.P.H.I.A. was in pieces and the parts he had collected from his first dealings with the Mutant Bosses were missing. Little does Jason know that there are more lightning beings where the first one came from and they are planning to destroy the Earth. The beings started digging towards the Earth's core in order to shift the planet's weight off its axis, leading to total annihilation. The parts from S.O.P.H.I.A. are being used to create a robotic army to assist the being in accomplishing their mission. Now, Jason must stop them, but he won't make it without the help of S.O.P.H.I.A. Since he can't recover the parts, he decided to redesign it to better prepare himself for the ordeal facing him. After 29 days, S.O.P.H.I.A. was completely rebuilt and ready for battle. Remembering where he saw the being's footsteps, Jason jumped in his vehicle and headed towards the mountains where the challenge begins.</desc>

The main differences involve reduction of some of the skills and equipment types present in the computer version. Limitations have been imposed on character creation as well: there are only four character classes (Warrior, Rocketjock, Medic, and Rogue) and three races (Human, Desert Runner, and Tinker) to choose from, as opposed to five character classes and six races in the computer release.

In the computer version, first-person view and pseudo-3D graphics were used for navigation, while combat was viewed from isometric perspective. In this release, isometric view is used both for navigation and combat, the player-controlled party visible from third-person perspective.</desc>

		<name>Cannon Fodder</name>
		<desc>Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this innovative top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once).

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

		<desc>The game follows the tale of Chakan, a warrior who was so confident in his martial arts (especially his unmatched swordsmanship) and gifted abilities in sorcery and alchemy, that he declared even Death couldn't best him in battle. Of course, Death appeared and challenged Chakan with a proposition. If Chakan could defeat him, he'd be granted eternal life. However, if Chakan was defeated, he'd become Death's eternal servant. In another side-story, Chakan was so feared by the elders of multiple tribes, they dropped their petty differences and amassed to figure out a way to defeat or contain him, and upon overhearing his boasting, summoned the Grim Reaper themselves, informed the Reaper of his boastings, and contracted him to defeat Chakan.

The battle raged on for several days, spells and swords clashed, until the ultimate victor was very clear...Chakan. Because he defeated Death eventually, he was granted his "reward":

“You are a tactful swordsman, so I will not renege on our wager. I grant you the kiss of eternal life, but, for your arrogance and pride I will temper my gift with this curse. You will be a mere shell of yourself as I strip you of most of your powers. Each nightfall, evils will be shown to you, and the pain of their victims will be your pain. You will never know rest as you wander this world searching to slay the horrors that haunt your sleeping world. You will suffer grievous wounds, but you will not die, and as eternity rolls on, you will crave my touch. Your face will bear my visage, and your eyes will burn with hellfire. But...let it not be said that I am without mercy. There shall be an end to your curse. If all the beasts of the dark are slain, then you may find rest."

Chakan will live forever until he destroys the four supernatural evils of the terrestrial plane (Spider-Queen, Mantis, Elkenrod, and Dragonfly King) and the elemental plane (Parasite, Tundra Beast, the Last Dragon and the Leader of the Dragonfly Clan).</desc>

Shown from a slightly tilted 3rd-person side perspective, players can do an exhibition match, full tournament or go against a human player in the 2-player exhibition mode. The different teams are ranked by speed, offense and defence, and different team formations can be selected.

The gameplay is very basic: players can pass, shoot, tackle with a third button used to switch between players. In the options menu, fouls and offside can be disabled, the amount of time per half can be determined and there is a radar and mini-map to track the other players. The European edition is endorsed by Ryan Giggs and the game uses a password system to continue tournaments</desc>

When a player makes 2 baskets in a row, the announcer says "He's heating up", and if he makes 3 baskets in a row without the other team scoring, he says "He's on fire!", which makes it easier to score.
In the season mode, the player can pick from 44 teams, and then play a 20 game season against quality competition. In the tournament mode, 16 teams compete for a chance to win the national championship. The player also has the ability to edit teams and players. The game itself is not realistic, as players can easily make full-courts shots and occasionally, players get struck by lightning as they dunk.

		<desc>Combat Cars is a racing game in which the player not only competes with other cars, trying to outrun them, but also uses all kinds of weapons and gadgets to damage their opponents. In the beginning of the game, the player can choose one of the eight available characters. Each character has his/her own strengths and weaknesses (speed, car handling, etc.), as well as unique weapons. The weapons include a simple gun, glue spots they can leave to trap other cars, homing missile, and others. There are 24 different tracks available in the game. The player must complete them in a linear fashion, and once they run out of time, the game is over.</desc>

The game features a 3/4 pseudo-3D perspective similar to that available on the SNES console in Mode 7. There are 32 college teams to choose from in four conferences, and games are played by official NCAA rules. Available gameplay modes include Single Game, 2-on-2, Slamfest (a simple slam-dunk contest), and Tournament. The AI can take control of defense, and the game can be played without foul rules.</desc>

		<desc>Dino Dini's Soccer is a top-down football game for the Sega Mega Drive programmed by Dino Dini, the man behind the first two Kick Off games by Anco Games. It was only released in Europe.

Dino Dini's Soccer is a retooled version of an earlier Amiga game, Goal!, sporting superior graphics and support for four players via Sega's Team Player peripheral. Though this has not been confirmed, it has been suggested that during development Dino Dini's Soccer was set to be a straight port of Goal! with no extra features (this being the situation with the SNES version, which despite its name, was not personally handled by Dino Dini like this Mega Drive release). An unconfirmed working title appears to have been Dino Dini's Goal!.

As a spiritual sequel to Kick Off 2 (or Super Kick Off, as it appeared on the Mega Drive), Dino Dini's Soccer offers similar gameplay but with the addition of smarter AI, multiple cameras and improved presentation.</desc>

		<desc>"Dinosaurs For Hire" does not really have a plot. Unknown monsters and weird robotic creatures attack the Earth. For some reason, the only ones who can stop the invasion are the three Dinosaurs for Hire: Archie, a tyrannosaurus rex and their leader; the triceratops Lorenzo, lover of fine food, fine wine, and fine clothes, and the one-eyed, unpredictable stegosaurus Reese. Each dino has its own strengths and weaknesses. You guide the dinosaur of your choice through the platform levels of the game. You are equipped with a gun: tons of enemies will attack you from all the sides, so your best bet will be walking with the fire button pressed down. You can shoot to all the directions and also engage in melee combat when the enemy is too close. Each level has a boss enemy waiting for you in the end. There is also a cooperative two-player mode.</desc>

		<name>Double Dragon II: The Revenge</name>
		<desc>Double Dragon II: The Revenge (ダブルドラゴンII ザ・リベンジ) is the sequel to Double Dragon. It was released for the arcades in early 1989, although it has a copyright date of 1988 due to the prototype testing conducted that year. The arcade version was essentially an improved version of the first game, featuring revamped graphics, a different combat system, new bosses and all new music, while retaining the same level structures and enemy characters from the first game. The Famicom/NES version, released by Technos at the end of the same year, was a completely different game that shared only the basic premise and a few superficial similarities in levels and character designs.

The Sega Mega Drive version, released by PALSOFT exclusively in Japan in 1991, is notably the only console version of the game that was actually a conversion of the arcade game, as the later PC Engine version released in 1993 by Naxat Soft was a remake of the aforementioned Famicom version. However, the Mega Drive version was poorly received by critics and was never picked up for export release as a result.

While the Mega Drive version has no official credits, it is known that the sound conversion was handled by Hitoshi Sakimoto, while Masaharu Iwata, who composed the game over theme for this version, claims that Quest may had handled the actual conversion.</desc>

A future re-release to a primary American audience was announce by Piko Interactive in 2015. The earlier Sega Saturn version was a port of the PC game; Tec Toy's version contains graphics and sound effects from the PC version, but has substantially different gameplay mechanics, levels, and a simplified game engine.

It is widely speculated to be an extensive hack of Zero Tolerance, but this remains unconfirmed. The legal status of the remake is disputed; 3D Realms claims that it is not legal while Tec Toy claims that they obtained a license from publisher GT Interactive (now defunct).

The game solely contains the second of the original games three episodes. This episode is called Lunar Apocalypse but the levels are redesigned to better suit the new game engine.</desc>

The rather complex menu-based controls of the original game have been replaced by a context-sensitive cursor system, where a unit reacts according to what is below the cursor - either moving to a destination or attacking an enemy unit, for example.</desc>

But despite his efforts, he could never find even one of the idols. Now it's up to the grandson to continue his work, fifty years later. But the evil syndicate leader Brady Tressider has his own plans, and will do anything to stop Earnest...

This is an action platform game in which you control Earnest Evans, armed with his trusty whip. The hero can jump, climb ropes, crouch, and crawl. There are plenty of obstacles on the levels (bottomless pits, spikes, crushing bridges, lava, etc.), as well as gangsters and monsters to dispose of.</desc>

There are four different game modes to choose from: Playoffs, Single Game, Season and another season mode that lets the player act out the 1994 NFL season schedule.  It also had variable weather conditions that the players on the field would react to and a battery back-up to save games.

The first criminals in the wanted list can be stopped with your service weapon an some fast reactions, but once you're facing the toughest criminals in town you'll need to use the cyber suit, which provides additional protection and higher firepower.

Unlike other versions of this game, this Genesis cartridge doesn't follow the layout of the arcade game. The levels, rather than being linear, feature some platform elements, and the enemies in the first levels are no longer bank robbers or hit-men, but soldiers and robots instead. And the setting is no longer your typical American city, but a futuristic megalopolis.</desc>

		<name>Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land</name>
		<desc>Crystal Mines is a 1989 unlicensed puzzle game for the NES by Color Dreams. When they established Wisdom Tree, they repackaged the game twice: in 1991 as Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land and in 1992 as Joshua &amp; The Battle of Jericho, with Joshua labeled a sequel to Exodus. These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively.
Though the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US — therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout).

Gameplay of both versions is identical: you are the main character (Moses or Joshua, respectively) and you must collect all the bags with M on them (Joshua: coins with $ on them) scattered throughout each maze. A and C shoot; you can hold them down for rapidfire. Shooting destroys blockades and enemies. Once all the M bags are gathered, find the exit to move on to the next level. In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game's theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation).</desc>

For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free. You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit. Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually. Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time. This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes. A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game. You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.</desc>

Weather can be customised in the Time Attack mode but is randomly chosen in Grand Prix mode, while you can only choose one of the D-tier teams (the 4 weakest of the 16) in grand Prix mode, but can drive for McLaren, Williams et al in Time Attack.</desc>

		<desc>Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</desc>

The biggest change from FIFA International Soccer are obviously the dozens of club teams from England, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, United States, Spain and Brazil, taking the team number tally to over 200. This also increased the number of competitions, with each country having it's own League, Tournament and Playoff. Also new, a battery backup allowed to save up to four competitions in the cartridge, replacing passwords. For those who want to settle things the fast way, a Penalty Shootout training mode was added.</desc>

		<name>FIFA Soccer 96</name>
		<desc>FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.

There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.</desc>

While each country got the same game ROM, each country got slightly different packaging featuring players from that country's national soccer team. It is supposedly the last officially-licensed Mega Drive game released in Europe (but this is unconfirmed), and was released exclusively in this region.

As with its predecessor, the Mega Drive version is an isometric game which lacks the 3D technology seen in other ports.</desc>

Conrad finds himself in the jungle, and from that moment on his quest for survival and his lost identity begins.

Flashback: The Quest for Identity incorporates elements of platforming, shooting, and problem-solving. The game can be described as a "cinematic platformer" (commonly referred to as Prince of Persia-style), following a design philosophy that was also manifested in Delphine Software's previous work, Another World. Compared to that game, Flashback focuses more on platforming and exploration of large levels.</desc>

You can choose pitchers and batters, based on their statistics and form. Bowling options are set to define the delivery, with fastballs and curveballs as well as more precise setting of pace and height. Fielding is optional - it's best to leave this to the computer at first You can always alter the infield and outfield depth and shift.</desc>

Paint: 

A paint program that offers different tools and brushes, a few pre-made backgrounds and objects as well as the option to import figures that were created in the sub-games 'Stylin' Stuff' and 'mix 'n match'.

Games: 

Mouse Maze: A Pac-Man-clone in which the player guides a mouse through a top-down labyrinth. To complete a level, all cheese symbol have to be collected while cats have to be avoided. Collecting a bone temporarily transforms the mouse into a dog that can kill the cats.

Space Lazer: A  shooter seen from the cockpit of a space-ship. The player controls a crosshair and has to shoot increasingly difficult enemies.

Whack a Clown: This game is exclusive to the Genesis Version and plays like 'Whac-a-Mole' only with clowns instead of moles.

Music: 

Songs can be composed by choosing from several instruments and putting notes onto a stave. It is also possible to add sound effects (animal noises and others) or edit provided songs.

Style: 

This section contains two mini-games:


Stylin' Stuff: Here, the player can edit the sprite of a woman by selecting different clothes, hats or haircuts.

mix 'n match: Sprites can be created by putting together different heads, torsi and legs.</desc>

Gameplay consists of flying through six air and water levels: Gadget Bay, Zeppelin Attack, The Lost City, Sub Attack, The Crystal Lake and Thump's World. Although the game continually scrolls throughout its stages, the player can fly in all directions on the screen. Bop and Bump come equipped with a spring glove mechanism that lets the player punch either up, down, right or left, which is used to defeat enemies.

Defeated enemies drop coins. There are also chests littered throughout the stages which contain coins also. These coins can be spent at a shop where the player can purchase upgrades.

The game also contains bonus stages where the objective is to open all the chests in a limited amount of time.</desc>

The space terrorists, Gulfer, plan to harvest the pollution to make some sort of garbage weapon. The good guys, the Leezaluth, aren't happy about that, so they decide they have to blow up the Earth before Gulfer gets at it. They give Earth an ultimatum: destroy Gulfer or Leezaluth destroys Earth. To help them out, Leezaluth gives Earth's last hero, Dan, a special weapon: the TOZ system.

Why don't the Leezaluth just stop Gulfer themselves? It's not exactly clear.

So, we have the premise for a side scrolling shooter. The star attraction here is the TOZ system. The TOZ is an orb that follows your ship around, and can be shot at enemy ships to absorb their weapons. Using the TOZ, Dan will fight through 8 stages filled with lots of enemies and really large bosses.</desc>

Of more significance, however, is the game's Artificial Intelligence system, in which creatures monitor how you play, and try to find safer positions. Also, the game offers more bonuses and power-ups if you're struggling to progress. Even without those, there are lots of bonus sections to find and unlock.</desc>

		<name>Golden Axe</name>
		<desc>The game takes place in the fictional land of Yuria, a Conan the Barbarian-style high fantasy medieval world. An evil entity known as Death Adder has captured the King and his daughter, and holds them captive in their castle. He also finds the Golden Axe, the magical emblem of Yuria, and threatens to destroy both the axe and the royal family unless the people of Yuria accept him as their ruler. The character of Death Adder and the stolen Golden Axe could well be traced to the historical event of the Acquisition of the True Cross during the Sassanid-Byzantine wars, as the Norse mythology is heavily influenced by Greek and Middle Eastern mythologies.
The player controls one of three Warriors. The first is a battle axe-wielding dwarf, Gilius Thunderhead, from the mines of Wolud, whose twin brother was killed by the soldiers of Death Adder. Another is a male barbarian, Ax Battler, wielding a two handed broadsword looking for revenge for the murder of his mother. The last is a long-sword-wielding Tyris Flare, an amazon, whose parents were both killed by Death Adder.</desc>

In Grind Stormer the ship always moves at a fast speed and the player can collect bombs that damage the entire screen and fend off bullets. The other variant V Five takes a Gradius-approach to power-ups, having the player advance through a selection of power-ups shown on the right by collecting tokens. In the first mode power-ups are immediately applied. In the second mode the ship is much slower and the player needs to decide to spend tokens on speed power-ups right away or save them to advance to seeking bullets or additional power.</desc>

		<desc>Gunstar Heroes is a side scrolling shooter. The player has four weapons to choose from, and they can be combined in various pairs to create a total of 14 unique weapons. In addition to the weapons, the player can engage enemies in close quarters combat. It is possible to grab and toss enemies, perform sliding and jumping attacks and a long-range skid.

Unlike most games in the genre, the player has a life total calculated in numbers. Death to a player requires multiple hits but just one death will issue the option to continue from the start of the level or to end the game. Players have unlimited continues.

The main highlight of the game are its boss encounters, which often feature large enemies made up of multiple sprites allowing for fluid movement.</desc>

Initially you can fly and kick as needed.

Once this section is complete, you move on to one-on-one combat of the Street Fighter 2 style. The early foes have far less energy than you begin with. As you progress through the game, you are awarded extra attacking moves, in a manner similar to Brutal: Paws of Fury</desc>

		<desc>Huan Le Tao Qi Shu: Smart Mouse (歡樂淘氣鼠) is a Sega Mega Drive game developed by several Taiwanese developers in some unknown year. While the name of the dev team is never given, there is a staff list — much of the staff come from Chuanpu, but there's no confirmation this was one of their products. Some of the music is also stolen from Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair, whose sound driver the game uses.

The game itself is a basic Pengo clone — the goal is to destroy all the enemies in the stage without getting hit. A pushes a block.</desc>

		<desc>Hurricanes is a 1994 platformer for various systems, including the Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear, by U.S. Gold based on DiC's Hurricanes cartoon. The MD and GG versions were only released in Europe (a SNES port developed by Probe was released in the US). Each version has different levels.

Instead of being a soccer simulator, the game is a platformer similar to Marko's Magic Football: you play as one of the players on the fictional Hurricanes football team as they use their football to destroy enemies through various platforming levels.</desc>

		<desc>Licensed by the International Management Group (IMG), this rare Electronic Arts venture into Tennis features 32 professional players (all male and licensed by the IMG) including Bjorn Borg, Marcelo Rios, Patrick Rafter and Yevgeni Kafelnikov in 15 tournaments with different surfaces. Game modes include exhibition, tour and tournament for both singles and doubles.

Along the usual offering of lobs, volleys, passing shots, top spins and slashes, the player can leave player movement to the console, and just focus on hitting the ball with the right shot with the correct timing (the player can also set the playing style, from all-court, baseline, or rush net). For those needing a boost of confidence before entering competitive play, Vic Braden, one of the most well known tennis coaches, has a court with special lines, a ball machine and some hints to help them improve their play.</desc>

It is a sequel to International Superstar Soccer, a Super Nintendo game originally released in late 1994, and the second in the long-running International Superstar Soccer, now Pro Evolution Soccer series by Konami.

The earlier Super Nintendo form of ISS Deluxe is notorious in South America for being redistributed as localised ROM hacks, replacing the teams and players with those from Argentina, Colombia or Peru. This has happened to this Mega Drive version too, becoming Futbol Argentino 96.</desc>

		<desc>Izzy's Quest for the Olympic Rings is the official game of the mascot of the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. As the name suggests, Izzy must find the five Olympic rings, hidden by the guardians so that Izzy does not take them to his world.

The game plays a lot like Mario games; to eliminate an opponent Izzy must jump over his head. There are two jumps available, the ball jump suitable for height and the hurdle jump, suitable for distance. Both allow Izzy to clear an enemy, but the second harms him.If Izzy is hit, then he must find three medals, or at the next hit he loses a life. There are some extra objects, like Olympic torches, and eggs that hatch either objects for bonus points, trampolines or morph points to reach otherwise inaccessible areas or traps. Izzy can also morph into a glider, a baseball player, an archer or a rocket, among others, to overcome some sections of the levels.</desc>

		<desc>The game stars the green-haired Joe and the blue-haired Mac, cavemen who battle though numerous prehistoric levels using, weapons such as boomerangs, bones, fire, flints, electricity, stone wheels, and clubs. The objective of the game is simply rescuing a group of girls who were kidnapped by a rival tribe of cavemen. The gameplay is somewhat similar to Contra and has a Gauntlet-style health system, where the player loses health over a period of time apart from in boss battles. This health system is also not unlike that of Sega's Wonder Boy. The game could be played in either single player or two player mode. In the two player mode, both characters could hurt each other. The game was also notable for its cartoony graphics, humor, and sound effects.

The original arcade version had the distinction of allowing the player to select between different routes (much like Taito's Darius) at the end of a boss battle. Also, after defeating the final boss, the players can choose between three exits, each one leading to a slightly different ending sequence.</desc>

There are 28 teams from the '92-'93 season, two All Madden teams and 8 Greatest Ever teams.

Game modes are the usual pre-season, regular season, sudden death and playoffs. A special playoff mode for the 8 greatest teams is also available.

The Genesis version features John Madden's digitized commentary speech and a battery-backed RAM for saving playoff results and player stats</desc>

		<name>Joshua &amp; The Battle of Jericho</name>
		<desc>Crystal Mines is a 1989 unlicensed puzzle game for the NES by Color Dreams. When they established Wisdom Tree, they repackaged the game twice: in 1991 as Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land and in 1992 as Joshua &amp; The Battle of Jericho, with Joshua labeled a sequel to Exodus. These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively.
Though the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US — therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout).

Gameplay of both versions is identical: you are the main character (Moses or Joshua, respectively) and you must collect all the bags with M on them (Joshua: coins with $ on them) scattered throughout each maze. A and C shoot; you can hold them down for rapidfire. Shooting destroys blockades and enemies. Once all the M bags are gathered, find the exit to move on to the next level. In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game's theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation).</desc>

		<desc>Ka•Ge•Ki is a slightly-angled 3rd person beat-'em-up set around underground fighting matches a la Pit-Fighter in which you must take down every member of a notorious biker gang. Each match begins with a showdown with several weaker henchmen and then moves on to next of the 9 gang members, who must be KO'd 3 times before moving on to the next round.

The game allows you to move your character in any direction, provided he doesn't leave the confines of the arena, and allows you to attack via mostly a combination of button presses that also trigger dodges and parries depending on the button pressed.

Graphics are 2D with a unique super-deformed design (stocky bodies with gigantic heads).</desc>

		<desc>Kick Off 3: European Challenge is a football game developed by Steve Screech for Anco Games as a sequel to Kick Off 2 (which made it to the Sega Mega Drive in the altered form of Super Kick Off). VIC Tokai published a version for the Mega Drive in 1994.

Unlike its predecessors, Kick Off 3 had no involvement from lead programmer Dino Dini, and thus plays very differently to other games in the series, having a "horizontal" pitch as opposed to a "vertical" one. Due to these radical changes, the game was met with controversy upon release. Dino Dini released his own football game around the same time for the Amiga titled Goal!, which made its way onto the Mega Drive as Dino Dini's Soccer.</desc>

Since the international version did not retain the Hokuto no Ken license, the graphics and characters' names were altered. It was the second Hokuto no Ken game released by Sega, following the Mark III original (released internationally as Black Belt). Versions for the Commodore 64 and Amiga based upon Last Battle were developed and released by Elite in Europe in 1991.</desc>

		<desc>The European Wars against Spain and France have been costly to the British Empire. In order to gain additional funds for the war effort, the Crown raise taxes from the New World colonies without representation. This act compels the New World colonies to protest and boycott against British rule. By 1775, the Crown alarmed by the protests, boycotts and politically instability in the New World sends troops to subdue any rebellious efforts by the New World colonists. This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen Colonies to revolt. Thus starts the War for Independence in the New World (American Revolutionary War).</desc>

You can play these teams in a regular exhibition game or sudden death overtime game, or take the 1993 teams through an entire season.

		<name>Madden NFL '96</name>
		<desc>Madden NFL '96 is a football video game designed for the 1995 NFL season, licensed by the NFL . It features John Madden on the cover. The AI has been boosted and can now hurry in two-minute drill situations, spike the ball, and cover the receivers with better efficiency.

Among the innovations in Madden 96, the Create A Player feature was added, which included many position specific mini-games that would determine the ability of the player.

The game also was the first in the Madden series to include secret "classic" teams, which were unlocked by playing any of the 28 pre-expansion NFL franchises in the playoffs and by winning Super Bowl XXX with that team (a rather easy feat as the playoff tournament system allows a player to abort the game while in the lead and still win). The 28 pre-expansion teams were each represented by a classic era equivalent, which ranged from 1960 (Philadelphia Eagles) to 1986 (New York Giants), although all players identified as number-only. Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers, having debuted in 1995, did not have a secret classic team revealed in this manner, nor did the All-Madden team. However, Carolina was attached to the blank slate NFLPA team used for Create-A-Player, and Jacksonville and All-Madden hid the "superteams" with players named after the developers; these teams were accessed using unstated cheat codes.</desc>

The player must hit as many of the "bad" creatures as possible, while leaving the princess and the dog untouched. Some creatures wear helmets and must be hit several times to be defeated. Between each stage, there are minigames where bonus points can be earned, and there are six stages total. Also supported is a special nine-button "Smash Controller" specific to this game.</desc>

The physics are customized to each of these, so expect sprint cars to slide around on the dirt tracks, and the slipstream effect is detectable.

There are 27 computer-controlled cars with individual profiles, and 8 cars to choose from in each race, with varying engine, grip, brakes and pit crew standards. You can view the action either from behind the car, or from the nose. In longer races you must monitor the pit strategy, with the options of a splash 'n' dash stop if your tires are still fine.</desc>

		<desc>Fed up with continuous losses in tournament battle, Shao Kahn, who had lost to Liu Kang in the Outworld tournament, enacts a 10,000 year-old plan. He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she wouldn't be revived in the Outworld. She would be resurrected in the Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen.
When Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her. As a consequence of his action, the Earthrealm becomes a part of the Outworld, instantly stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, as Raiden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld.
Shao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earthrealm and kill any survivors. Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn. Eventually with his final defeat, every human on Earthrealm comes back.
Mortal Kombat 3 follows Mortal Kombat II and shares continuity with both Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Mortal Kombat Trilogy which were both updates of this game. The next new game in the series was Mortal Kombat 4.</desc>

Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</desc>

		<name>Operation Europe: Path to Victory 1939-45</name>
		<desc>Operation Europe: Path to Victory is a multiplatform war game where one or two players can compete in World War II action. The object of the game is to fulfill any one of the military objectives for either the Axis or the Allied forces. Players engage in modern warfare around Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and North Africa.

This game uses abstract numbers and figures in the map view and saves the concrete illustrations of soldiers only when they lock horns on the battlefield or in an urban setting. Urban settings give a traditional 1930s view of housing and office buildings that provide extra protection for units that are guarding them. However, there are massive numbers to crunch and the lack of graphics help enhance the number crunching ability of game's artificial intelligence.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures</name>
		<desc>In Pac-Man 2, the player plays the role of an observer and assistant that follows Pac-Man as he sets out to accomplish various tasks. Pac-Man himself walks around in a cartoon world and interacts directly with the player, as well as with objects and other characters. The player cannot control Pac-Man directly, but instead can direct his attention in various directions, and is armed with a slingshot that can be used to strike certain objects, including Pac-Man himself.
Pac-Man's mood varies throughout the game, usually in response to his environment or the player's actions, and generally his mood affects his actions and his willingness to cooperate with the player; the varieties of "bad" moods can at time compromise the player's ability to progress. There are a few instances, however, where Pac Man is required to be angry. Hitting objects with the slingshot can often get Pac-Man to look at that object and piece together parts of the puzzle he is currently trying to solve - for example, hitting a door may cause Pac-Man to go inside a house to discover a clue. But beware - a few objects when hit can also produce disastrous (and humorous) results. Hitting a trash can on a city street at the wrong time, for example, can cause a cat to jump out and attack Pac-Man.
Throughout the game, Pac-Man is occasionally harassed by the four ghosts from the classic Pac-Man games. When this happens, Pac-Man is paralyzed by fear and eventually faints, unless the player gives him a power pellet. Then Pac-Man becomes Super Pac-Man for a brief time and flies around, eating the ghosts. In some cases, the ghosts may leave behind important objects.</desc>

The player's loyalties may change over the course of the game; he may also hold rank with multiple countries and may turn to piracy at any time. Gameplay is open-ended; the player may choose to attack enemy ships or towns, hunt pirates, seek buried treasure, rescue long-lost family members, or even avoid violence altogether and seek to increase his wealth through trade. The game also has no predetermined end, although as time goes on, it becomes more difficult to recruit crew members. Also, as the player character ages, fighting becomes more difficult, and deteriorating health will eventually force the character into retirement. The game ends when the player retires, at which point he is given a position in his future life, from beggar to King's adviser, based on accumulated wealth, land, rank, marital status, and other accomplishments.</desc>

		<desc>The player begins Pit-Fighter by choosing one of the three playable characters, who all have different moves, speed, and power. As many as three people can play at a time, but there will be extra opponents to fight during any of this game's 15 different matches.
Every third fight is known as a Grudge Match. In a Grudge Match, the player must fight against a CPU controlled clone of his or her fighter (if playing alone) or the other players in a multiplayer game. Each player has three "knockdowns" - getting knocked down three times eliminates them from the Grudge Match, the winner is the last man standing. This match plays more like a bonus round, in that there is only results are gaining or failing to gain bonus money, and losing the Grudge Match does not eliminate a player.
The final battle, the "Championship Match", is between the player and the mysterious entity that taunts between matches every once in a while, the Masked Warrior. If more than one person is playing the game before this match, they must fight each other to the death until only one becomes victorious and can fight him.


Buzz posing after taking down the Executioner.
The player must jump, punch, and kick their opponent until his/her energy runs out. If the player presses all three of the buttons at a time, the character will perform a "super move".
Sometimes during matches the player will come across foreign objects such as knives, crates, sticks, motorcycles, and bar stools that can be thrown at you or your opponent. The player may also come across a power-up known as the "power pill". If the player or the opponent grab this item, one will become temporarily stronger and take less damage from hits.
Sometimes even the crowd will interfere in the fights. Two characters, known as Knife Man and Knife Woman, will come out of the crowd and stab the player with their daggers. The player can take these nuisances out with one hit. Sometimes there is also a fat bearded man with a stick. If the player knocks him down, the player can take the stick and use it against the current opponent.
The audience will also push any fighter that ends up among them, and stays there more than a few seconds. They will be forced back into the fighting area.</desc>

		<desc>In this game you take on the role of 1 out of 8 teams who represent various nations vying to become the Powerball champions. Powerball is a game consisting of a hybrid of sports such as American football, soccer and rugby. You play on an 100 yard field trying to score on the opposing team. Scoring consists of either running into your opponent's end zone holding the powerball for a touchdown or kicking the ball into your opponent's net to score a goal. Goals are worth 1 point, and touchdowns are worth 3 points. The game modes are 1 or 2 player exhibition play, and 1 or 2 player league play. League play allows you to use bonus points, and distribute them to your teammates to improve their statistics.</desc>

Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.</desc>

Training lets the players team practice without an opposing team on the field. Exhibition is the basic one team versus another for one game. The tournament mode is divided into two different modes; 8 Nations and World Cup. 8 Nations is just a shorter version of the World Cup tournament mode because it involves only 8 teams instead of all 32 of them like it does in the World Cup mode.</desc>

Putter Golf is essentially (but whether or not it officially is is unknown) a Mega Drive version of Putt &amp; Putter: a very simple golf game with an isometric perspective. Rather than compete on wide open courts however, the game opts for much smaller levels which would only require a putter (much like minigolf). As well as this, there are a number of obstacles which can get in your way, from bumpers to lava.</desc>

		<desc>Red Zone is a helicopter action shooter in which you pilot an AH-64B Apache into the heart of enemy territory to thwart the plans of a nuclear armed dictator. Under threat of global nuclear war the dictator has begun to annex his neighbor countries, with plans to continue his territorial expansion, so three special operatives are covertly sent in with a lone gunship to remove his ability to wage war.

The majority of the game consists of air-to-ground attack while flying in the Apache, using its hefty loadout of rockets, guided missiles, built-in 30 mm cannon and defensive infrared air-to-air missiles in order to eliminate the hostiles from the air, land and sea. Fuel drums, repair kits and ammunition depletion are both factors to keep in mind, and careful planning of where the pickups are located so that the chopper is able to stay in the air and is able to keep fighting, elements that are very similar in implementation to the Strike series. Differences between the games include the fact that as your systems get damaged, your helicopter becomes harder to control and the weapon and radar systems become affected.</desc>

		<name>Risky Woods</name>
		<desc>Unusually for Electronic Arts in the early 90s, this was a platform -shooter game with little or no adventuring or strategy elements. The game scrolls sideways, and has sections where precision jumps are required, either to clear rivers or collect bonuses. You carry a dagger to deal with the enemies, and must avoid contact with them. When killed, they leave coins to be collected - these are spent in the shop sections. Death loses you most of your coins, but they can usually be retrieved if they land on solid ground - making it better to be killed in combat than by drowning.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the first season of the TV series of the same name, your character is an officer of the UEO: The United Earth Oceans Organization. You begin the game inside a training simulation, which upon successful completion ensures your transfer to the crew of the seaQuest DSV where you will be called upon to perform the same duties.

Primarily, your function is to navigate the seaQuest Deep Submergence Vessel around the underwater map to various 'mission areas' where you will be called upon to use the on board vehicles to accomplish some task. Typical missions include salvage operations, rescue operations, disarmament of underwater explosives, termination of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater property is deducted from your budget and completion of objectives adds to it. The money must be used to resupply weapons and buy additional vehicles. Underwater is a dangerous place.

The vehicles you have at your command includeSpeeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up &amp; down and change orientation between facing left and facing right
Stinger: A prototype "next generation" attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.
Sea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is the only vessel that can dock with other vessels and one of only two that can pick up undersea objects for transport. It comes with a water jet to clear debris and a retractable drill
Sea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it's orientation between left and right. It's weapons are torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea objects for transport
Remote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. It's main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switches
Darwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach. Darwin is able to activate switches.</desc>

It is the sequel to The First Samurai, a beat-em-up released for various home computers and the SNES internationally a few years prior.

You play as one of two Samurais (the 1-player mode has the male protagonist from The First Samurai only; the 2-player mode lets the second player control a new female Samurai). A and B both attack depending on what weapon you have equipped right now (only one at a time, some in limited quantities), what enemies/objects are nearby, and which D-pad buttons you are holding at the time. C jumps. A screen at the beginning of the game (also accessible from the Options menu) shows you what each in-game item does for you.

A Sega Mega-CD port was advertised, but never released.</desc>

		<desc>Shi Jie Zhi Bang Zheng Ba Zhan: World Pro Baseball 94 (金冠軍兄弟象世界職棒爭覇戰) is a baseball game for the Sega Mega Drive by C&amp;E Inc.. While the game is an unlicensed Mega Drive game, whether or not the game also carries a license to use teams represented — or whether or not any actually exist — is unclear — C&amp;E's site states they started making games with team licenses in 1993.

When batting, C swings and A changes posture. When pitching, C pitches. You appear to have some control over your players when the ball is in the air and the other team is batting (TODO).</desc>

		<desc>Shining Force is a turn-based tactical RPG. Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies 1 square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don't count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed.</desc>

		<name>Shining in the Darkness</name>
		<desc>Shining in the Darkness is a "dungeon-crawler" RPG. The game puts the player in control of the main character as he and two friends (Pyra and Milo) explore 3-dimensionally rendered dungeon mazes.

The game consists of story line interaction, dungeon exploration, random monster fights, and predetermined 'boss' fights. The combat in this game operates similarly to certain RPG games of the same era (e.g. Dragon Quest). Monster encounters happen randomly during dungeon exploration at which point turn-based combat proceeds.
Additionally, the dungeon contains three characters in need of rescue. Rescuing any or all of the three is optional, and the story changes depending on whether or not the player locates and returns each of these characters to safety.</desc>

		<desc>Shove It! follows a burly warehouse worker, whose aspiration is to earn enough money to buy an expensive car and impress the ladies. What must this worker do? Move boxes.

The worker is placed in a special grid, and there are only a few different types of blocks: movable crates, locations for crates, and barriers. Crates can only be pushed, not pulled, and only one at a time. The object of each stage is to move each crate to one of the designates spots where crates must be placed. When this is complete, the worker progresses. There is a multitude of stages, grouped in clusters of ten apiece.</desc>

The game also comes with modes for 2 players with two variants: 2P Pocket Game (the traditional mode) and 2P 9-Ball Game, where the premise is to sink 9 balls before the other player makes them first. If you prefer, test your target in Trick Game or even hear your favorite song in Jukebox.

After each stage completed (and some luck), a bonus stage will appear, as well as the chance to earn extra balls. You will only need a good target in the parquet block!</desc>

		<desc>Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles is a game that results when Sonic 3 is locked-on to Sonic &amp; Knuckles via Lock-On Technology. It acts as one large combined game and all the levels from Sonic 3 and Sonic &amp; Knuckles become available. 

There are several noticeable differences when playing the games combined. Knuckles is playable in the Sonic 3 levels and Tails becomes available in the Sonic &amp; Knuckles levels. Also, all of the levels from both games are accessible, starting from Sonic 3. Once these levels are completed the Death Egg falls off screen intact instead of being destroyed, and then the play continues straight to the levels of Sonic &amp; Knuckles. The final boss of Sonic 3 is also omitted for Sonic and Tails.

After collecting all the Chaos Emeralds of Sonic 3 a new quest becomes available when entering the first special Stage in Mushroom Hill Zone which allows you to collect seven new Emeralds called "Super Emeralds". When these Emeralds are collected, Hidden Palace Zone will become available, and Sonic can transform into Hyper Sonic and Knuckles can transform into Hyper Knuckles. Tails has no Hyper form, but the Super Emeralds are needed for him to transform into Super Tails, as the Chaos Emeralds alone have no effect on him.</desc>

This cart, determined to be near exact to the one shown in two 1992 episodes of Nick Arcade, predates the more famous Simon Wai prototype. It was found and sold to drx in cartridge form for $1500 via a community effort.

In this version, only one zone can be normally played: Emerald Hill Zone. The rest of the Zones can be played only through a Level Select code. The level select screen is completely identical to the Japanese version of Sonic 1, and even contains the original Green Hill Zone, which is somewhat unplayable because of strange physics (caused by differences in how collision data is handled between Sonic 1 and Sonic 2).</desc>

Utilizing energy produced by the magma flowing under the volcano, this new monstrosity (the Veg-O-Fortress) has the power to transform helpless animals into robot slaves at an astounding rate. Sonic the Hedgehog and Tails fly onto the scene to mount an aerial assault, but Sonic is knocked off the wings of Tails' airplane by a blast from the fortress. He falls into the water, but is rescued and taken to the subterranean levels of the Veg-O-Fortress. The fortress must be destroyed from the inside-out, and the only way to make that happen is to trigger an eruption in the volcano it's built on. Sonic knows this can be done by removing the Chaos Emeralds that keep the volcano stable. Robotnik, however, is also aware of the fragile relationship that exists between the Emeralds and the mountain, and he's set up an elaborate Pinball Defense System to make sure the precious jewels don't go anywhere.</desc>

		<desc>In the first level, the player controls Spider-Man who must use his spider sense to disarm several bombs located throughout the immediate exterior and maze-like entrance to an abandoned building. After the player completes this level Spider-Man learns that the evil Arcade has kidnapped Storm, Cyclops, Wolverine, and Gambit. The player must successfully complete each character's level (each set in Arcade's deadly "Murderworld") in order to get to control Spider-Man in a final battle with Arcade.

After completing each stage, the player controls each hero as they fight in similar-designed mini-levels themed after the "Behind-the-Scenes" of Murderworld. The only character to have a significant change is Storm, who now walks, shoots multiple bolts of lightning rapidly and calls upon gusts of wind, and jumps about four times the height of the other characters. The last level takes place inside a large room, where Arcade chases Spider-Man back and forth in a large Arcade-shaped robot, which operates like a Matryoshka Doll, until Arcade is finally defeated. The X-Men stand-by at the edges of the room, occasionally attacking on their own.</desc>

Steel Empire is notable amongst shoot 'em up games for its unique aesthetic designs. Mostly low-tech in nature, with it being set in the late-19th century of an alternate world, the game's aircraft, weaponry, powerups, environments, enemies and bosses are heavily stylized adding strong steampunk elements to the style, themes and visuals of the game. Steam power, propeller-based aircraft, biplanes, dirigibles and heavily-armored steam trains with giant cannons play large roles in the game's protagonists and opponents.</desc>

The player takes control Strider Hiryu, the youngest elite-class Strider in the organization. Hiryu is summoned by the organization's second-in-command, Vice Director Matic, to assassinate his friend Kain, who has been captured by hostile forces and has become a liability to the Striders. Instead of killing him, Hiryu decides to rescue Kain from his captors. With the help of his fellow Strider Sheena, Hiryu uncovers a conspiracy between a certain faction of the Strider organization led by Matic himself and an unknown organization known simply as the "Enterprise" (headed by a man named Faceas Clay) which involves the development of a mind-control weapon codenamed "Zain". In the course of finding and destroying these Zain units, Hiryu learns that the faction of conspirators is headed by Vice Director Matic himself. Hiryu eventually tracks Matic to an orbiting space station where the two Striders face off; after a brief battle Hiryu bests Matic and kills him. Afterwards Hiryu locates and destroys the last of the Zain units.

In the epilogue, it is revealed that though Hiryu was asked to return to the Strider organization he instead opted to retire. The final credits show him sheathing his weapon and walking away.</desc>

At the beginning of each level the player is shown a wanted poster, showing the criminal, the reward for stopping them, and the cliché line "Wanted dead or alive".</desc>

		<name>Super Baseball 2020</name>
		<desc>Different from real baseball and other baseball video games, this game consists of both male and female characters, as well as robots. All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher.</desc>

For unknown reasons the game was not released in cartridge form in North America, but is currently unconfirmed as being a Sega Channel title. It eventually saw a more widespread release as part of the Wii's Virtual Console service.</desc>

		<desc>Super Hydlide (originally entitled Hydlide 3: The Space Memories) is the third entry in the Hydlide series, continuing its action RPG legacy. Character creation allows the player to choose one of the four character classes: Warrior, Thief, Priest, and Monk. In combat, the protagonist uses melee or long-ranged weapons or casts magic spells. Unlike the previous games in the series, the player is required to press the attack button during melee combat, instead of simply "bumping" into the enemies. There is an internal clock in the game, which makes it necessary for the protagonist to sleep periodically and regain his strength. The main character also has to eat from time to time, otherwise his hit points will gradually decrease. The morality system from the previous game returns: killing friendly creatures will reduce the player's morality level, which will eventually have an effect on one of the game's most decisive battles.</desc>

		<name>Super Smash T.V.</name>
		<desc>The year is 1999. The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</desc>

A distinctive feature that also appears in the arcade game is the use of different viewpoints during the entire game; during normal gameplay and when fighting sub-bosses, the game utilizes a third-person perspective from behind the helicopter, similar to Space Harrier, but the camera changes to a top-down perspective when fighting bosses. Super Thunder Blade had four stages of play.</desc>

		<desc>Sword of Vermilion is about the son of Erik, king of Excalabria, who takes on a quest of revenge to defeat Tsarkon and free the world of Vermilion from evil.
In the town of Excalabria the people went about their business, and tended to the fields. One day, vicious fighting broke out everywhere as the army from Cartahena, led by the wizard-king Tsarkon, swarmed all over the town. The townsmen were overwhelmed, and the castle of King Erik V collapsed. Erik V summoned his bravest, strongest and most faithful warrior, Blade, and gave him his infant son and an ancient family heirloom, the Ring of Wisdom. Erik ordered Blade to save himself and the child while the castle burned. Blade traveled to a small village named Wyclif, where he settled down and raised the child as his own son. Eighteen years later, the son of Erik begins his quest.
The quest consists of travelling to towns and villages, battling creatures to gain experience and finding items such as swords, shields and armour, as well as many other items such as Herbs and Candles. Boss monsters take the form of larger, stronger creatures which are integral to the story. Fighting Boss Monsters takes place on a side on view of the battle where magic cannot be used.
The titular Sword of Vermilion is the most powerful weapon at the end of the game.</desc>

		<desc>The game puts the player in charge of a self-named corporation in a gritty near-future cyberpunk-style world. Game play involves ordering a four-person team of cyborg agents around cities displayed in a fixed-view isometric style, in pursuit of mission goals such as assassinating executives of a rival syndicate, rescuing captured allies, "persuading" civilians and scientists to join the player's company or simply killing all enemy agents.
As the player progresses through the game, they must manage the research and development of new weaponry and cyborg upgrades. The player has only limited funds, requiring taxation of the conquered territories while ensuring that they are not so over-taxed that they revolt against the player. The player begins the game with simple pistols, progressing through increasingly destructive weaponry that includes Uzis, miniguns, flamethrowers, sniper rifles, time bombs, lasers and the enormously destructive Gauss gun (a rocket launcher). In addition, the player can use items such as medikits to heal his agents, scanners to locate pedestrians/vehicles and the "Persuadertron" to brainwash the player's targets into blind obedience.</desc>

The game features Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse trying to figure out why everyone in the circus has disappeared, and includes four different types of outfits and six different levels. While the SNES and Genesis/Mega Drive versions were practically identical, the GBA re-release in 2003 included some new features. As its predecessor, it received praise for its graphics and outfit system and was criticized for not being challenging enough and short. Notably, it was the first game with Minnie Mouse in a video game role.</desc>

Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of isometric death await.

The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards.</desc>

		<desc>At a time when computer games were being blamed for violence, bad language, epilepsy and everything else the ‘moral majority’ needed a scapegoat for, Virgin gave us: The Road Safety Game. Or not, as this is a standard platform game with a twist of questionable taste and purpose.

You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress through levels filled with hazards such as cars and fireballs, within the time limits. Contact with each of these loses you a limb, and once you have none left, contact means game over. Since the character isn’t handicapped by missing limbs in any way, in practical terms you can think of these as hit points especially as there are screwdrivers to pick up which restore one limb.</desc>

In most versions of the game two bars appear on the HUD. To the left is the roar meter, which must be fully charged for Simba's roar to be effective. To the right is the health bar which decreases when Simba is hurt. At the bottom left of the screen is a counter showing how many lives Simba has remaining. Health can be restored by collecting bugs which come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some rare health-damaging bugs also exist.
The player controls Simba (first as a cub, then later as an adult) in the main levels and either Timon or Pumbaa in the bonus levels.</desc>

The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.</desc>

After escaping to their home planet of Funkotron, the characters discover that antagonistic Earthlings have stowed-away on the duo's spacecraft.

A sub-plot involves ToeJam and Earl's attempt to lure Lamont the Funkapotamus back from the Funk Dimension, where he is hiding from the invading Earthlings.

ToeJam and Earl must hunt down Earthling antagonists, which include a "pneumatic-drill-crazed construction worker, a camera-wielding tourist, our old friends the bogymen [sic], pea-shooter armed kids and a rather rotund woman with ankle-snapping poodles.

Capturing Earthlings involves rummaging for them in bushes and trees, before pelting the antagonist with "jars" which imprison them. The player completes a level by catching all the at large Earthlings and sending them back to Earth via spacecraft.</desc>

Whether you're infield or outfield, at the plate or on the mound, stealing bases or catching fly-balls, the competition is hot and you're even hotter now that you're playing with a big leaguer like Lasorda. And you've got control. Curve balls, fastballs or sliders are some of the wind-ups you'll pitch to outwit your batter. But be prepared when he connects, you'll have to think fast to make your players perform like a well-oiled machine. Are you up for a single, double, or even triple play? It all depends on how you throw the ball. But don't worry, you'll get your chance at bat. This is a race for the Pennant, so you better hope Tommy's on your side.

These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password.</desc>

Instead of bombs you can call helper planes. These planes make a formation around you and help to shoot all enemies.

Along the way you get the chance to collect power-ups by shooting transport trucks. When these are destroyed they release a power-up. There are three types. First is the weapon upgrade, with this you get a wider and more powerful shot. Second, you get more calls for helper planes. And third are extra lives.</desc>

		<desc>First you choose one out of four different characters to represent you, Scarlet (red army), Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or Madcap (blue army). The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any other, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises. 

Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles. Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.</desc>

		<name>Virtua Racing</name>
		<desc>Virtua Racing is a home port of Sega's first ever 3D, polygon-based racing game for the arcade. The game consists of racing Formula-1-looking cars around a beginner, intermediate, or expert track, competing against a second player or computer drivers. Despite having Formula-1 cars, the game controls are very "arcadey" and players can see the leap they made from here to Daytona.

The Megadrive/Genesis version of Virtua Racing is of note as it is the only game for the system which features the SVP chip (Sega Virtua Processor). The chip is a 3D processor built into each cartridge (the console itself had no 3D capability) and is very similar to the SNES's SuperFX chips, used in games such as Starfox and Stunt Race FX.</desc>

		<desc>Bart's reality goes virtual when he is strapped into Martin Prince's Virtual Reality experiment at the elementary school science fair. Each virtual reality program represents a stage in the game that Bart must play through in order to escape the machine before the programs crash.

The game consists of three side-scrolling platform stages and three stages that take place from a rear view. Bart assumes the roles of a pig, dinosaur, and baby for the platform stages. He tosses tomatoes and eggs, slides down a water slide, and drives a motorcycle in a post-apocalyptic Springfield for the three remaining stages. They are all accessed by chance via a wheel-of-misfortune.</desc>

The game was notable for its soundtrack, an arrangement by David Whittaker of the song Megablast (Assault on Precinct 13) (which is also where the game's subtitle comes from), originally from British group Bomb the Bass. While North America and Japan got some of the other versions of the game, the Sega versions remained exclusive to Europe.</desc>

		<name>Zero Wing</name>
		<desc>Zero Wing is an horizontal shooter game where the player is in control of a ZIG, an escape pod released after its main ship was attacked and destroyed by the evil cyborg CATS, bent on taking over the world.

Like most games in the genre, there are three color-coded weapons: red (scatter), green (homing) and blue (lasers). Each weapon has three levels of power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must be collected sequentially. However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then throw him against his peers, destroying them.

The game (more precisely, the European PAL version of it) is known for being the origin of the grammatically incorrect phrase in the English translation, All your base are belong to us, which has since become an internet phenomenon.</desc>
