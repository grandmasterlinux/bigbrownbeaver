		<desc>ADIDAS POWER SOCCER ’98 brings the action of soccer to the PlayStation. Thanks to the dynamic camera technology, you’ll get the best view of the action and the camera won’t miss a single flick pass, slide-tackle, or short dribble. All of this combines to make the game feel like a live broadcast.

If realism is not what you are looking for, or if the refs keep rewarding your play with red cards, then switch from the Simulation mode to Arcade mode. With fewer rules and faster play, Arcade mode creates a wide-open game with lots of scoring. ADIDAS POWER SOCCER ’98 provides enough action to keep both fans and casual observers of soccer engrossed in the world’s most popular sport.</desc>

		<desc>Crash Bandicoot, a heroic, agile and mutated marsupial who must save his girlfriend Tawna. The main antagonist is Doctor Neo Cortex, a mad scientist who was often ridiculed by the scientific community for his outlandish (but nearly workable) theories and is now motivated to prove his tormentors wrong by creating a mutated army of beasts to conquer the world. Cortex's henchman is Doctor Nitrus Brio, the insecure creator of the Evolvo-Ray. Crash's love interest is Tawna, a female bandicoot about to undergo experimentation by the Doctors. Helping Crash in his journey is an ancient witch doctor spirit named Aku Aku, who has scattered masks of himself throughout the islands to grant Crash special powers. The boss characters of the game include Papu Papu, the obese and short-tempered chief of the native village; Ripper Roo, a demented kangaroo with razor-sharp toenails; Koala Kong, a muscular but unintelligent koala; and Pinstripe Potoroo, the tommy gun-wielding bodyguard of Doctor Cortex.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy VI</name>
		<desc>Final Fantasy VI is a role-playing video game. It was released in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System as a part of the Final Fantasy series. The game was known as Final Fantasy III when it was first released in North America, as the original Final Fantasy III had not been released outside of Japan at the time. However, later localizations used the original title.

Set in a fantasy world with a technology level equivalent to that of the Second Industrial Revolution, the game's story focuses on a group of rebels as they seek to overthrow an imperial dictatorship. The game features fourteen permanent playable characters, the most of any game in the main series. Final Fantasy VI was the first game in the series to be directed by someone other than producer and series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi; the role was filled instead by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito. Yoshitaka Amano, a long-time contributor to the Final Fantasy series, returned as the image and character designer, while regular composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote the game's score, which has been released on several soundtrack albums.</desc>

		<name>Jet Moto 3</name>
		<desc>Gameplay in the Jet Moto series differs traditional racing games, as players instead control hoverbikes which hover close above the ground and can be driven over both land and water. Most of the courses in the games are designed to take advantage of this ability. The game has a its variant of the traditional road course, but also introduces a new course type, known as a suicide course. Instead of being a continuous loop, these tracks have checkpoints at either end of the course, and the starting grid in the center. Characters race to one end, then turn around to head for the other checkpoint, repeating the process until all laps are complete. This provides a new gameplay dynamic as often the player must navigate oncoming traffic.Characters are split into teams, and bikes are adorned with logos of products such as Mountain Dew and Butterfinger, similar to real-life sponsored racing.</desc>

Besides offering 31 NFL teams (including the Cleveland Browns), authentic players with ratings based on the 1998 season and 31 official stadiums, the fourth game in the PlayStation series expands the coaching features to go along with 1998's Season, Franchise, Tournament, Practice and Exhibition play modes. 

This means you'll be able to create your own plays from scratch, test them out in the Practice mode and add them to your favorite NFL team. In addition, you can create your own camera angles, rearrange each team's depth charts and select twelve audibles (six on offense and six on defense) in order to change plays at the line of scrimmage.</desc>

		<desc>While most shooters of this type released during the mid-to-late '90s focused on shooting monsters or criminals in order to advance levels, Namco's Point Blank brought back the old school style of shooting. Originally introduced in 1994 as an arcade gallery shooter, the game focused on the player's ability to aim accurately and shoot fast.

In 1998, the idea remains the same, though Namco has made a few adjustments for this home version. Packaged with the company's own Guncon light gun, Point Blank offers the full arcade game with new gallery shooting levels, a Training Mode, and a multiplayer mode (head-to-head or tournament).</desc>
