		<name>10-Yard Fight</name>
		<desc>The game is viewed in a top-down perspective and is vertical scrolling. The player does not select plays for either offense or defense. On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempt to run with the quarterback, toss the ball to one of two running backs, or throw the ball to the one long distance receiver - basically the option offense. On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted.</desc>

		<desc>CONTROL MAN AND BIRD IN A FIGHT FOR THE EIGHT JEWELS OF POWER!

After hundreds of years of chaos, mankind has finally emerged from the ruins of nuclear war. This world of the distant future has once again fluorished under the guidance of the Great King, who harnessed the power of the 8 Eyes to rebuild the planet.

These strange jewels of power were formed at the eyes, or centers, of the eight nuclear explosions which nearly destroyed the Earth. In the wrong hands, the 8 Eyes could cause untold destruction...And now, they have been seized by the Great King's eight Dukes, in a desperate bid to gain control of the world for themselves. They have banished the King to the nuclear wastelands, and already their squabbling threatens to plunge the world into war once again!

The task of retrieving the 8 Eyes falls to you, Orin the Falconer, the bravest and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen. With your fighting falcon, Cutrus, you must penetrate each of the eight Dukes' castles. There you will face the Dukes' soldiers, and battle strange nuclear mutants such as living skeletons, giant wasps, and mud men. You must defeat the monstrous Boss of each castle to retrieve the Jewel of Power he guards.

Then, to complete your quest, return the 8 Eyes to the Altar of Peace to await the return on the Great King, so that he may finish the rebuilding of Earth. Your reward will be the the eternal gratitude of all mankind!</desc>

It seems that with each waking day another grussome discovery is made... another neighborhood teen has mysteriously passed away into the dark stillness of the night. Everyone says it's "natural causes," but it seems as if something (or someone) has been picking them off one by one in their sleep. It's a horrible nightmare come true... and this nightmare has a name: Freddy Krueger.

It's up to you and your remaining friends to search Elm Street for his bones, which have been scattered about then collect and burn them in the High School furnace. If you can just stay awake long enough, you might be able to end Freddy's reign of terror for good. You had better hurry though, it's getting late and you can feel your eyelids getting heavier and heavier by the minute.</desc>

		<desc>While Heroes of the Lance is a faithful representation of the books it is based on, it was a departure from the usual RPG style of most Dungeons &amp; Dragons games, and many players lamented its difficult game play interface which consists of using one character at a time in horizontally-scrolling fighting. Each character has different types of attacks and spells making them more suited to fighting different enemies but they merely act as "lives" for the player as in more traditional fighting games, removing one of the main strategies of role-playing games from the game.</desc>

Whatever it is, you - and all your friends - will have a great time trying to guess what the pencil is drawing. Guess right and you'll get a crack at the really tough puzzles - no dots or clues, just the pencil drawing a picture. Think you're up to it? Then challenge your friends. Or take on the computer. Either way, this off-the-floor board game will challenge you, excite you and generally drive you crazy for years to come.</desc>

		<desc>The full-court action between the Arch Rivals is really hot tonight. Here's Mohawk, taking it to the hoop... POW! He just got nailed in the alley with a right cross! FOUL! FOUL! FOUL!
What?! No Foul? That's right. No Fouls. This is basketball where breaking the rules is part of the rules! If you can't block a shot - knock your opponent's block off. If you can't steal the ball - steal his shorts! But don't think these tactics are enough to win. Arch Rivals still requires real B-ball skills like passing, shooting, ball handling, slam dunks, and 3 point shots.
Based on the arcade smash hit, Arch Rivals brings all of its hard-hitting "in your face" action into your home. Whether you're going for a fast break, dodging food on the court, or crashing the boards 'til they shatter, Arch Rivals isn't just basketball... it's a basketbrawl!</desc>

		<desc>A chess board is lined with trolls, wizards, knights and other magical beings. Just another strategy game? Don't count on it. When you challenge a square held by the enemy, the board explodes into a battlefield. Your strategic skills on the game board will determine your fate in battle as you take on your opponent in a heartpounding duel to the death.

With sixteen different characters and an ever-changing board, you'll never play the same game twice.

If the Goblin catches air with his club, the swift sword of the Knight may steal a leg or two.

The Sorceress has no fear of the massive, boulder-heaving Golem. One of her powerful spells could quickly send him into the next time zone.

Explosive battles! Fire an arrow, cast a lightning bolt, or scorch your opponent with a fire ball. Seven magic spells! Imprison the enemy, heal your creature's wounds, reverse the flow of time and more. Summon the Elementals! Air, Water, Fire and Earth are all at your command. One or two-player action! Challenge the computer or test your skills against a friend.</desc>

		<name>Astyanax</name>
		<desc>Astyanax is a side-scrolling platform game. The controls are fairly simple: the A Button makes Astyanax jump, the B Button will attack with an axe called Bash, and a combination of up and attack will perform a special magic attack. The game also contains a few role-playing elements, such as weapons upgrades. It had a unique feature (for the time) of a bar that grows between attacks; the length of the bar determines how much damage Astyanax will do with his next attack. If one attacks rapidly, one's hits will do little damage, much unlike most games where a rapid succession of hits would all be equally damaging. A very similar system would be used in Secret of Mana some years later.</desc>

But after getting behind the wheel of a nuclear-powered sports car turned time machine, you find yourself in the year 1955 where you've accidentally tampered with history. Now it must be corrected. You must somehow make sure that teenagers Lorraine Baines and George McFly (the two kids that will eventually grow up to become your parents) fall in love before the photo of your family fades away and you're left with nothing to come home to. It won't be easy. You'll have to protect George from Biff and his gang of bullies while doing your best to keep them from beating you up instead. To complicate things, Lorraine has a crush on you, so you'll have to dodge her advances while trying to figure out a way to get George and her to kiss at the school dance. Time is wasting and even if you manage to put all of the pieces in place, there is still no guarantee that you'll get back. It will all come down to one brief moment in time when the past, present and future all meet.</desc>

The intro says: "Rampant ninja related crimes these days... Whitehouse is not the exception...". As soon as that occurs, a Secret Service agent (who resembles Arnold Schwarzenegger as he appears in The Terminator) asks two street-smart brawlers, named Blade and Striker: "President Ronnie has been kidnapped by the ninjas. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue Ronnie?", which this quote became an infamous meme and is often lampooned on the Internet. In the Japanese version, however, the words are completely different. After they heard that, the Bad Dudes confirmed it by pursuing the DragonNinja through the city streets, highway, sewers, transport train, forest, cave and into the secret ninja base, in order to save President Ronnie.</desc>

Every one of the 18 holes has familiar golf hazards - bunkers, slopes, and water hazards. You'll also have to contend with some of Mother Nature's hazards like changing wind conditions and Pebble Beach's most difficult obstacle - the ocean.

Once you tee off you'll have all kinds of decisions to make. Check your score card to see how you're doing. The card tells you the distance in yards and par for each hole. The computer gives you a bird's-eye view and cross-sectional view of each hole, as well as close-ups of the green. You select the right club for each shot. Control your shot to get the power, distance, and hook or slice you want on the ball. After you've made your shot the computer tells you what kind of lie you have as well as the remaining distance to the hole.</desc>

		<desc>Frigid winter winds swept over an already chilled Gotham City. Random street crimes were running at an all-time high, despite the holidays. Down below, in the city's frozen sewers, Oswald Cobblepot, known as The Penguin, planned more mayhem and schemed the take over of the fightened metropolis.

		<desc>Bigfoot was a racing game released in July 1990 for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  It was developed by Beam Software and published by Acclaim.  The game was advertised by the legendary monster truck of the same name in the cartoon segment of the 1990 television show Video Power, titled The Power Team.  The show also often used sound effects for the actions of not only Bigfoot, but others as well.  The gameplay involves racing monster trucks including the title truck, Bigfoot (blue). The computer controlled trucks are green (The Growler) and yellow (The Charger) if the computer's truck runs out of money and cannot repair their rig.  It was not uncommon for a skilled player to be challenged by three to four different monster trucks during the game.  In two player mode the 2nd player's truck is red.  The object of the game is to advance to the next level (race) with incurring the least amount of damage as possible.  The levels consist of car crushing, mud bog, tractor pull, hill climb and the later levels are a combination of everything except the sled pull, simply called a drag race.  To advance to the next event the player must complete a "cross country" race collecting money, points, etc. without damaging the truck.</desc>

The game's plot is not an adaptation of the movie, but rather serves as an original continuation to the film's events.  The story begins when Rufus summons Bill S. Preston Esq. and "Ted" Theodore Logan for a mission.  Both boys arrive at different times; first Ted then Bill.  They are informed that time-space rebels have gone back in time, kidnapping various historical figures and leaving them stranded in different time periods.  So now they must travel to the time periods, retrieve these figures and return them to their correct time periods.  This must be done as soon as possible; for if history isn't made right, the boys will miss the big concert that will launch Wyld Stallyns' music career.  Unfortunately, Rufus can only loan out a pay phonebooth for this trip.  Once the mission is explained, Ted leaves and Bill arrives later.  Rufus states that since they both came alone, it's best that they work separately.  From there Bill is brought up to speed on the situation.  Bill is instructed to go back in time and leave items to help Ted along the way in each time period he visits.  When Bill has done this he will start his own search.  Ted will also do the same for Bill's search after he has found a historical figure.</desc>

		<name>Bill Elliott's NASCAR Challenge</name>
		<desc>Bill Elliott's NASCAR Challenge is a simulation of the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit, and thus operates like a racing game.  The gameplay action was always through an in-car perspective.  Players could chose to run single races at each track or run for the season championship.  The race distance was chosen by the player, which ranged from 10 miles to the realistic distance of 500 miles for the superspeedway races.  In the MS-DOS version, the championship consisted of a visit to each of the eight tracks.  In the NES and Game Boy versions, the season championship consisted of each of the four tracks run twice, for a total of eight races.  Championship points were awarded consistent to the real-life Winston Cup of the time.  Both the MS-DOS and Nintendo versions allowed the player to setup the car, with effects to be seen.  Both of those versions also allowed the player to choose whether they would race with the effect of damage on their car or not.  However, a large enough collision with another racecar on the track always would result in the player going out of the race in an out-of-control crash.</desc>

		<name>Bo Jackson Baseball</name>
		<desc>It is based on Bo Jackson's baseball career.  An option allows the player to play anywhere from five to nine innings.  Nintendo Power gave this game a 2.8 out of 5 in their September 1991 review while Electronic Gaming Monthly issued a 4.25 out of 10 review in their October 1991 issue of their magazine.  Players can either play in exhibition mode or playoff mode. Either one or two players can participate.  In addition to those options, a CPU vs CPU mode and a CPU vs CPU quick mode are available in order to quicken up a tournament; the purpose is to see the stats of that particular match and quickly end tournaments.  The game uses city names but not the team names because of not having any proper licensing with Major League Baseball.  However, the players are purely fictional and they cannot be edited.  Some of the player names are parodies of real life baseball players (such as Baltimore's "Kenrip" being a not-so-subtle parody of Cal Ripken).  There is even a cheat code that allows players to play as an all-Bo Jackson baseball team.</desc>

Bonk's mission is to rescue Princess Za (a small pink Pleisiosaur-type reptile) who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool (a large, green Tyrannosaurus-type dinosaur).  In the Arcade version, Bonk is also assisted by a female version of himself.  Bonk attacks enemies by "bonking" them with his large, invincible forehead.  Bonk starts the game with three hearts' worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage and three extra lives.  Bonk's health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.  Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger.  There are three stages of power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable.  Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat.  The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time.  A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power but will eventually decay into the first stage of meat power, and then back into regular Bonk.  Eating a small meat while in stage two will put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power.  And eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power.  Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart which restores all of Bonk's missing health.  There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart.  Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air.  Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small "smiley" power-up.  Bonk's smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage.  The player is given additional points and a caveman type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.</desc>

		<desc>BUCKY'S GONNA NEED A LOT OF LUCK FROM HIS RABBIT'S FOOT!

Today's newest renegade space hero, Captain Bucky O'Hare, faces his greatest challenge. His crew, Dead Eye Duck, Blinky, Jenny the Aldeberan Cat and the genius earth boy Willy DuWitt, have been captured by the Toad Empire. Now you must play the role of Bucky, blasting past the fiercest toads in the Aniverse. It's an intense arcade action battle with eight hare-raising levels. Luckily, when you rescue a crew member you can assume their identity and take advantage of their unique fighting skills, like Jenny's Super Mind Blast and Willy's Laser Cannon... WE INTERUPT THIS PACKAGE FOR A SPECIAL BULLETIN FROM TOAD HEADQUARTERS!

Greetings, warthead. This is the Toad Air Marshall, coming to you live from the Toad Magma Tanker. I'm here to smash an ugly rumor goin' around that says you're thinking about becoming Bucky O'Hare in a futile attempt to rescue the captured crew of the Righteous Ingignation.

Fool! Those lunkhead traitors are guided by the elite Storm Toad Troopers in four toad prisons hidden throughout the planetoid belt, from the Way-Cool Ice Planet to the Burnin' Hunk of Lava Star. So don't even mess with us toads, you wart for brains hare-ball. 'Cause it you do, I'll have to blast ya Toad Battle Cruisers and Double Bubble High Speed Toad Armada Tanks. That ain't the worst of it, pal! Once I've got your pointy ears in my sights, I'll drop the big bomb with Crater Centipedes, Robosnakes and triple threat Triborgs that your laser-guided Wart Remover doesn't have a shot against.

Face it rabbit. Try to croak us toads, and you'll be one unlucky Bucky!</desc>

		<desc>Burai Fighter is a side-scrolling shooting video game released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990.  The setting for Burai Fighter, according to the manual, is to fend off seven bases of Burai, super-intelligent cyborgs.  The player starts out with a relatively weak cannon but can upgrade to ring, laser and missile weapons, which are much more powerful.  The player can also choose from three difficulty settings: Eagle, Albatross and Ace, but the fourth difficulty setting, Ultimate, must be unlocked.  One proceeds by controlling the character in 8 directions and can shoot in a different direction from the direction he is looking.</desc>

		<desc>You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area. 

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.</desc>

		<path>./Cabal.nes</path>
		<name>Cabal</name>
		<desc>The player assumes the role of an unnamed commando trying to destroy several enemy military bases. The player's character is seen from behind and initially starts behind a protective wall (the wall can get damaged and shattered by enemy fire). The player must use a limitless ammunition gun and a limited number of grenades to fend off enemy troops and damage the base. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structures (usually the ones that collapse when destroyed, rather than simply shattering) are brought down. At the successful completion of a level by fully depleting the enemy gauge, all the remaining buildings onscreen collapse and the player progresses to the next stage. Boss fights, however, start from the beginning if a player dies. (A feature criticised by many players. It can be circumvented, however, if two players play simultaneously and at least one stays alive at a given moment.)
Power-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed onscreen. Some power-ups give special weapons: One of them is an extremely fast machinegun and other one is an automatic shotgun with a slightly lower firing rate, but has a larger crosshair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot. Others grant extra grenades or additional points.
Two players could play this game, cooperatively, simultaneously.
The arcade cabinet is a standard upright. Each player uses a trackball to move the player from side to side, and move the crosshairs about the screen. On later board revisions, a joystick was installed instead with an optional sub-pcb for use with a trackball. With a trackball, rolling (an invincible movement during which the player could not attack) is done by pushing the trackball to maximum speed.</desc>

Pogo's progress is hindered by enemies and obstacles which he has to avoid in order to reach the top of the tower.  The actual game play happens at each tower in turn.  Pogo starts from the bottom and has to find his way up to the top.  The towers are cylinder-shaped and have ledges on their outside, either horizontal, forming stairs or connected by elevators.  Because of the cylindrical shape, the towers have no "left" or "right" edges, instead allowing Pogo to walk all around the tower.</desc>

Your grim chances are kept alive in Transylvania, where cowardly villagers offer clues to the whereabouts of Dracula's remains.

Destroying this legion of Swamp Dragons, Slasher Skeletons and Forces of the Undead will be the supreme challenge for the mightiest of warriors. Your place in history is 100 years before Simon Belmont's birth. Dracula is young at heart, and it will take more than a stake to penetrate his evil. Luckily, you command the role of Trevor - Simon's forefather and the origin of the Belmont Warlord Chromosones. Trevor has a power never before seen by human eyes - the power to transform into three different spirits: Grant DaNasty, the ferocious Ghost Pirate. Sypha, the Mystic Warlord. And Alucard, Dracula's forgotten son. You must perfectly time Trevor's body transformations to match up his different fighting spirits against Ultimate Evils. Trevor also has the strength and wisdom to command the Battle Axe, Invisibility Potion and Mystic Whip. But the most important weapon Trevor has is your cunning to choose the correct Paths of Fate and your bravery to lead him past 17 possible levels of never-ending doom, including the Haunted Ship of Fools, the Sunken City of Poltergeists, the Clock Tower of Untimely Death and Curse Castle. Never before have so many dangers confronted you at one time. And if by some miracle you triumph, you'll no longer be a mere mortal. You'll be a legend who'll live forever!</desc>

		<desc>The main character in the game is a female driver, Clarice, of a Honda City (the North American version features a male driver) on a tour of all the sights and roads across the world. To prove that she has visited a particular location, she must drive around the location painting every section of the road white. However, the police, who have no tolerance for vandalism, attempt to stop the driver from completing her goal. The player's car can jump and fire cans of oil. To avoid forcing the player from retracing the same roads again, the roads change color when the car drives over them, indicating that that specific road has been painted. There are three main obstacles: police, cats and spikes. The police chase after the car and if a police car comes into contact with the main character's car, the car "explodes" by turning into a group of hearts and the player loses a life. To combat this, the player can obtain cans of oil, which can be used to cause the police cars to spin out of control, allowing the player to bump them off the screen. Other enemies include a cat, which, when hit, causes the player to lose an extra life as the cat goes diagonally off the screen (but does not cause the car to "explode") with playing of a comical music, "Der Flohwalzer", known as "Neko Funjatta" (I Stepped on the Cat) in Japan. There is also spikes, which make the car "explode" on contact. Occasionally, a balloon may float by during any given stage. If the car touches one of these balloons, it collects it and collecting three such balloons will activate a warp that sends the car multiple stages ahead and provides significant bonus points. Although the city you travel to will change, the difficulty pattern of the road will remain the same. As the number of cities you travel to loop endlessly, the game is not shortened by taking a warp. One particular thing about this game is the "catchy" tune that plays in the background as you enter a new city. Although it uses "ethnic" variations according to the destination, it's an adaptation of a famous classic piece, "Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso", from Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No.1.</desc>

		<desc>Concentration was a popular game show in the mid-to-late 1980s and this game was adapted from that television program. Two players can play against each other, or one person can play against a computer generated opponent. The answer to the puzzle is hidden by tiles. The tiles have words denoting game prizes ("Mexico", "Camera", "Telescope", for example) and your object is to find the two matching worded tiles. Exposing two at a time, your memory is taxed as more prize tiles are revealed and then covered over again. As more tiles are matched, the hidden puzzle is revealed. Solve the puzzle and you win the game.</desc>

		<desc>There are 25 stages in the game, including bonus stages. Each series of five generally contains one of each type of mission. The fifth are generally the boss stages. The bosses are a sea serpent (as seen on the cover), a giant crab, a giant squid, a red and black version of the sea serpent and a giant shark. The game uses a powerup bar similar to the Gradius series. Powerup pods are collected to move the selector to different powerup items. When the desired powerup is highlighted, the player can select it, after which the menu returns to an unhighlighted state. Menu options are "Turbo" (increase the speed of the boat), "Fire" (increase the number of bullets the primary gun fires), "Speed" (increase speed of shots and rate of fire), "Missile" (improves missiles) and "Force" (a force field around the boat plus replenished health). The speed boat used for game play starts with a single gun which can be upgraded to a quadruple spread shot. Missiles can also be added to the boat's arsenal and can be upgraded to heat-seekers. Between stages which are not connected by water, the Cobra Class has a helicopter style propeller that extends from the roof of the cabin. However, this flying state of the boat is never used in gameplay. The boat has a 12-point damage bar which can be reduced by contact with obstacles or enemy fire.</desc>

		<desc>Theodore "Todd" Thornley IV has had enough. After being humiliated once again by his rival, Jeff "Crash" Cooney and his blue-collar buddies from Southside High School at the All-City Track Meet, he has decided to issue a challenge to Crash. Inviting two of the other elite high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against Crash and his boys. The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players. Since there's never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers. Thus, a four player adapter is not required, unlike other Kunio-kun games.</desc>

The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7).

Players take the role of Dash Galaxy, a space scout who has been captured by a hostile civilization. Gameplay involves a series of floors with several rooms each. Keys must be collected to progress to higher floors and, eventually, an escape ship. Dash's only weapons are a limited supply of bombs and remote detonators. Good timing is crucial to completing the game, requiring navigation of trampoline jumps and roaming enemies. While the rooms are side-scrolling action puzzles, the floors have a  overhead view and include more difficult block-moving puzzles which can fatally trap a player.</desc>

		<desc>This sequel adds new enemy ships to the alien fleet such as firebombers, Yllabian Space Guppies (note that Yllabian is based on "Yllab", the word "Bally" spelled backwards, a friendly poke at Williams' then-competitor, Bally Midway), Dynamos and Space Hums. The Defender ship is now equipped with an Inviso cloaking device, which renders the ship invulnerable when activated, but has a limited charge. A Stargate will transport the ship to any humanoid in trouble. There are now two special stages, the Firebomber Showdown and the Yllabian Dogfight, that occur every fifth and tenth wave. As in the first game, if all the humans are captured the planet explodes and turns all the landers into mutants.</desc>

		<name>Desert Commander</name>
		<desc>The player's force consists of nine different types of units and one headquarters unit (which is a unit by itself and also can be used to attack). Each scenario gives a different set number of units to use, which the player can mix and match between the different typese without going over that limit. When in a one-player game, the second controller can be used to modify the CPU forces. When playing against the CPU, the computer will be given a different ratio of units to command than the player. On the easiest scenario both the player and the CPU have the same amount of units, on all others the CPU will have more than the player. There is no variance in artificial intelligence, so the only thing that makes the later maps harder is the larger number of units the CPU has. The game is turn-based with no time limit. The object of the game is to destroy the enemy's headquarters unit. The player that does so first wins. Units have different mobility range, which varies according to the unit type and (except for aircraft) the terrain. They also have different shooting range, though this is fixed and not depends of the terrain. All unit types have limited ammunition and fuel. In order to replenish them the player must land them at the appropiate buildings; for example, all aircraft must stop at an airport in order to recharge their fuel and ammo supply. A certain unit is particularly strong or weak against a particular opponent, performing average against every other unit types.</desc>

		<desc>The view of the game is from the cockpit of a spacecraft. The goal of the game is to explore a grid which is displayed on screen in search of opponents to destroy and to land on planets some of which refuel the energy and refill ammo to the player's arsenal of weapons which consist of his photon laser. This is his primary weapon while the torpedoes become his second weapon. After the player has destroyed every enemy that is on the grid, a number will be indicated. This number represents how many enemies are in that quadrant of the grid. After blasting numerous enemies, the player will finally be able to go to the planet labeled "B" on the grid. These planets are unlike the other planets as they do not refill the player's vehicles energy or ammo. Rather, they are an enemy base that proceeds with the player entering a 8-bit cutscene of his space craft entering the base's gravitational orbit with the game play changing from a first person cockpit you had on the grid stage to a horizntal 2D shmup stage similar to Konami's Gradius or R-Type. Using this perspective, the player can fire projectiles from the front or back of his ship.</desc>

		<desc>Bandai released their version of Dick Tracy in August 1990. The objective is to solve several mysteries without accusing the wrong person or shooting too many unarmed villains.
Each level starts out with a case to solve, and some possible clues. The player drives Tracy's vehicle through the city, avoiding snipers and other cars, to various locations mentioned in the clues, where the action shifts to a side-scrolling adventure game. If the player goes to the right location, he will find, during the course of his side-scrolling fighting, a clue icon that provides additional clues for the case, or the player will be able to speak with a character from the comics who give clues. There is one car chase in each level. Once the player has collected enough clues, he can drive to the location where the perpetrator is and arrest him.</desc>

		<name>Die Hard</name>
		<desc>There are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building and John McClane's task is to clear each floor of terrorists and he can then use the stairwell or the express elevator to travel upwards, to a maximum of floors 31-35 (more floors are unlocked in "Advanced" mode). In addition, by shooting at grids in the wall, John is able to climb in the vents, dropping into a designated spot or moving down or up a floor. At the start of the game, the player character can only use a pistol (with 15 bullets) and his fists to dispose of enemies, but later acquires several weapons, such as submachine guns, explosives and flashbangs which the terrorists can also use. When McClane is shot, a few picked up items can drop where he must pick them up again. However, bullets have minimal range, only shooting straight or on a 45 degree angle. McClane's health, which is drained by bullet wounds, can be restored by collecting soda cans from either enemies, snack machines (by shooting several bullets at them) or empty rooms. The player loses the game when all life is lost. The player has about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened, but can gain more time by destroying the main computer on the fifth level. Once all the locks have been opened, the vault is opened and the game's final battle is triggered. The player has only a few minutes to go to the 30th floor, for a final confrontation with Karl, Hans and any of the 40 terrorists left alive. One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. However, after the second lock is opened, Hans will tell everyone to not use the radio. Also notable is the "foot meter". The meter starts out full, but will eventually decrease if the player character steps on shattered glass or runs around. If the meter becomes empty, McClane will walk much slower than he does when the foot meter is full. It can be restored by collecting med-kits. The game features cinematic sequences which change the story depending on which actions the player takes. For example, if there is fewer than one minute left and the player defeats Karl, the last scene with John and Holly will tell the player the roof has been destroyed by the helicopter sent by Hans.</desc>

A timer in the game represents the time remaining until the door to the next level closes, but the timer can be reset by standing on a special pillar. Monsters such as moles and mosquitoes seek to kill the protagonist.

In fact, the game begins with a digitized sample of that quote. The game play consists primarily of side-scrolling action. Dirty Harry can punch and kick the copious thugs that assault him using their own fists, guns, baseball bats, nets, and dynamite. The hero can also pull is .44 and aim it in 5 directions in order to pick off enemies, but the ammo is limited. Further, Dirty Harry has a number of other tools at his disposal, provided he collects them.</desc>

		<desc>The game features one and two player modes, both of which are single screen. In the first mode, the objective is to enter math answers in order to receive points. These questions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
In the two player mode, two players control two characters as they race to create a math formula to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, incorporating platform gameplay. The mechanics are similar to Donkey Kong Junior; players climb vines to reach higher areas in order to collect numbers scattered around the area. In order to complete mathematics problems, players must collect at least three things: the first number, the symbol necessary to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, and the second number. When the game features a high number, such as 66, players must collect multiple numbers and mathematics symbols in order to reach this. For example, players could choose a nine, a multiplication symbol, and a seven, followed by an addition symbol and a three to reach the number 66. The two player game have two different levels, Calculate A and Calculate B. Calculate B is more challanging, not only the goal is a negative number, but giving players the set number.</desc>

		<name>Double Dare</name>
		<desc>The video game version of Double Dare played exactly like its television counterpart. Rounds one and two were 10-question trivia rounds, each of which started with a toss-up challenge. Round three – the obstacle course – featured eight stages to be completed within 60 seconds. Toss-up challenges determined which team got initial control of the trivia round. To complete a toss-up, each player had to determine the precise speed and angle of whatever object they were throwing to hit a target.  Physical challenges were played the same way. All questions were multiple choice, and each player could use the up or down arrows on the controller to make his selection. Three possible answers and either a dare, double dare, or physical challenge option were offered. The player confirmed his selection by pressing the A button. Confirming a dare doubled the base dollar value of the question; a double dare quadrupled the base dollar value. The player with the most money at the end of round two went on to the obstacle course. In order to move through an obstacle, the player had to repeatedly alternate between pressing either the left and right or up and down arrows on the controller's D-pad. In order to grab the flag, the player had to position the on-screen contestant in just the right spot and then press the A button to jump and retrieve it. Some found it easier to get through the course by using the NES Advantage, a joystick controller, rather than the NES' standard controller. The obstacles are all based on real obstacles from the show (with one exception) and are randomized before a game. They include The Tank, The 1-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, The Fireman's Flagpole, The Monkey Bars, "Dallas", Mount St. Double Dare, Moonwalk, and an original obstacle designed like a triangular jungle gym. "Prizes" for beating the obstacle course included a BMX bicycle, television set, an NES console, and several other gifts, ending with a exotic vacation -- though it can prove very difficult to get the best "ending" by completing the last obstacle. The obstacle course's flag colour depended on which team was playing, if blue, the flags were blue, and if red, the flags were red.</desc>

There is a menu which has four options, open, get, go, and hit. There are 11 Warp Zones in all. At the end of each of the first 10 Warp Zones, Michael must fight a large monster that carries a piece of the Laser and guards a valuable piece of equipment, the latter consisting of the Ultra Space Sensor, four Life Bottles, the Air Helmet, the Jump Boots, two Blue Vitamins and the Shield Suit. Once Michael fully assembles the Laser, he'll be able to challenge the final boss, Canbarian.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Fighter</name>
		<desc>The player takes control of a magical human fighter who has the ability to transform himself into a flying dragon. As the fighter, the player can run, crouch, jump, and attack with his sword as he would in most side-scrolling action games. Underneath his life gauge is a "metamorphosis gauge" that will gradually be filled as the player destroys his enemies. When the metamorphosis gauge begins to flash, the player can transform into the dragon by pressing up and A button after jumping. As a dragon, the player will hover in the air while the screen scrolls automatically to the right, similarly to a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up game. The dragon's main attack is his fire breath. While the player can fly in any of the eight directions, they cannot turn around and the dragon will only face and attack to the right. While in dragon, the player's metamorphosis gauge will gradually be drained out. The player will transform back to a fighter if the metamorphosis gauge empties out completely or when the player rapidly taps the A button again.
As the fighter, the player can also shoot a projectile attack by holding the B button until the character begins to flash. The types of projectile fired by the player depends on the color of the player's outfit, which can be changed by picking up certain power-up items labeled with the letters G (green, the player's default color), B (blue), and R (red). Changing the color of the player's outfit will also change the pattern of the dragon's fire breath attack. Other power-ups includes energy restoring potions, a flower that helps fill the metamorphosis gauge faster, and a ring that destroys all on-screen enemies. At the end of each stage, the player will receive a staff that will increase their maximum health.
There are six stages in all, each with their own guardian awaiting to challenge the warrior at the end. The game will end if the player loses all of their life power and only three chances are provided to continue at the stage where they died before the player is forced to start all over.</desc>

		<desc>Dragon Power is an action-adventure game developed and published by Bandai for the Nintendo Entertainment System on March 3, 1988. It is a heavily localized version of the Japanese game Dragon Ball: Shenron no Nazo (translated to Dragon Ball: Mystery of the Dragon God), originally released on November 27, 1986. Although some of the European releases retain the Dragon Ball assets (under the title Dragon Ball), the North American release removes most references to the franchise. The game follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, as the young monkey-tailed boy Goku (along with his teenage friend, Bulma, known in the North American version as Nora), embark on a quest to find all seven Dragon Balls (Crystal Balls in the NA version), in which it is believed that collecting them grants the user any wish they desire. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version) and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).</desc>

		<desc>500 years ago, the Kingdom of Granville fought a terrible war with Darces the Dark Overlord. A great hero, the warrior "Magi", rose to challenge Darces. He owned six magical swords and a powerful suit of armor that was impervious to all but the most powerful of magic. Five of his six swords were Elemental blades, each created from the rarest metals on earth. The sixth blade, "Tores", used an even more powerful metal. Using his powers, Magi defeated Darces, and exiled him to a far away land. After defeating Darces, Magi grew old and died. Now, on a dark, stormy night in the Kingdom of Granville, Darces the Dark Overlord returns to the land. According to an old saying, "When the shadowed veil returns to mask the midday sun, the Fire of Serpents will rise again; Five shall become the One. The elements now heed his call, and hope is born alive; We will have our peace once more when One becomes the Five."</desc>

		<desc>Drivers earn thousands of dollars by competing in hydroplane races, setting track records, rescuing stranded people, and collecting cash bonuses. With these winnings they can repair or upgrade various components of the hydroplane to improve racing performance and remain competitive in the increasingly-difficult races. Eliminator Boat Duel offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Expert. Completing a race at a lower difficulty level advances the player to the next higher one. At each difficulty level, the player's hydroplane can be damaged from impact with animals, the opponent's hydroplane, and various stationary objects. A false start is penalized with a $2,000 fine. For most of a race, players control their hydroplanes from a bird's-eye view, and the screen scrolls in multiple directions; but in one segment of the race, the graphical perspective changes to a third-person tracking mode. In a single-player game, the player competes first with Seasick Sidney (in Easy mode), with Aquarius Rex (in Normal mode), or with Surfer Bob (in Expert mode). The player then competes against Vicious Vicky, Weird Willy, Mangler Mike, Veronica Alabaster, and Disaster Don (the reigning World Champion), respectively. To win, the player must defeat each opponent one-against-one on three unique race courses. Eliminator Boat Duel has 24 unique race courses.</desc>

(This differed from the game's packaging, which used the set from the Ray Combs era.) One or two players could play.
Just like the show, the object was to come up with answers to survey questions posed to 100 people. Correct answers were worth money, with $200 winning the game and the right to play Fast Money for $5,000, which was played exactly the same way as on the show (at least 200 points needed to win). $5 a point was awarded for unsuccessful playings of the round.
A player entered his answers by using the controller to scroll through the alphabet, contained in a string along the bottom of the screen; the answer had to be completed within a time limit. Reasonable similies to correct answers were accepted, and slight misspellings were also recognized.
Once a player won, they were given two options. The first was to stop playing, with the other being to continue on. A champion retired after winning over $20,000 automatically unless they were defeated.
If a computer-controlled family wins the game, no Fast Money is played with an excuse given to the form of "Due to (EXCUSE), the (NAMES) will not be playing Fast Money today". Excuses used include "tax considerations" and "a birth in the family".</desc>

Soon the ancient elf town of Eolis will vanish into eternity. Only you can save Eolis. No one else dares to venture beyond the walls, onto the World Tree, where towns and fortresses precariously await the whims of fate at the hands of the Evil.

You are searching for the water source and for an antidote to the poison that makes the water undrinkable. To find them you’ll need gold and food and magic, speed with a sword … and luck.

Every town holds a new mystery, every fortress a new danger. Merchants will sell you magic and valuable tools, but it’s up to you to figure out what you need. Long, secret mantras help you slip through the mists, but will you survive the next challenge?

This is Faxanadu, the legend, the adventure – the incredible journey on the World Tree.</desc>

		<desc>The Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game is a simplified version that allows players to practice up to six laps or qualify for every Formula One race of the season using metric units (kilometres per hour instead of miles per hour). It was one of the few 8-bit Formula One video games to adequately represent the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve as having an urban background along with several other urban race tracks represented in the 1992 Formula One season. Tire wear is possible resulting in trips to the pit crew for maintenance and repairs. A radio allows communication with the crew chief; he will advise whether repairs are necessary. The top speed of the vehicle is 325 kilometres per hour and turbo is not used in the game.
Before the first qualifying session can take place, the player must insert his name and his nationality. The name can be up to 10 characters long and the country has to fit into a three-character field. Since the game doesn't verify if the three-letter code matches up to a real nationality, it doesn't matter if the player makes up a nationality for a fictional country.</desc>

The object of the game is to rescue pets from trees and people from houses in the immediate neighborhood. There are 2 parts to this task: the first part involves navigating the maze-like streets from an overhead perspective in order to find the troubled residence. Once the house is reached, the second part of the job is to maneuver the firetruck's ladder underneath the person or animal in need of rescue, from a side perspective, and letting them down to safety.</desc>

		<desc>Fist of the North Star is a side-scrolling action game developed by Shouei System for the Nintendo Entertainment System, originally released in Japan by Toei Animation in 1987 and in North America by Taxan in 1989. The game is based on the manga series Fist of the North Star and is the second of four games based on the franchise that were released for the Family Computer in Japan and the only one with an overseas version. The game's plot is adapted from the second anime series, Hokuto no Ken 2, and covers the Gento Kōken story arc. The North American version is simply titled Fist of the North Star and is not to be confused with the original Hokuto no Ken for the Famicom, which was released exclusively in Japan. Despite being based on Hokuto no Ken 2, the North American cover artwork depicts Kenshiro fighting against Toki, who appears only in the first anime series.</desc>

One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan No Sho, or Book of the Mind's Eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji as a last request from a dying Juan. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, and begins to train him in Shorinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming "World Tournament of Contact Sports" as a representative of Shorinji. His motive is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. After learning from Gengai that it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls, he leaves for the World Tournament. There are two different types of gameplay. Journey levels are side-scrolling levels where Ryuhi must defeat five bosses and find certain items valuable to the mission. The tournament levels are where the player gets to fight one-on-one against enemies in the same way as the first game in the series released in 1985, Shanghai Kid. The player must go through the game twice to get the true ending. All six scrolls must be collected the first time through to get the first ending. The second time through the player needs to collect all six scrolls again, along with four crystal balls. The crystal balls can only be found in the second quest. However, players can miss one of these items and finish the game, but the true ending will not be received.</desc>

Though he was young, he made himself a master of Kempo. One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan-no Sho, or book of the mind's eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji in compliance with Juan's last request. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, regarded as one of the titans of Shourinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming "World Tournament of Contact Sports" as a representative of Shorinji. His desire is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. Ryuhi heard from Gengai that in truth it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls. As he leaves for the World Tournament, his thoughts are on his teacher Juan and keeping the fighting spirit burning. The game features combat in a variety of formats, such as kicking and using fireballs to repel monsters in scrolling stages, a system during one-on-one duels against Tusk Soldiers or a pair of martial arts tournaments where the player must attack a mark that appears on their opponent's body, or defend the area when it appears on them (this system is similar to Culture Brain's original Flying Dragon for the NES), and RPG-style command battles against monster bosses. When confronted by a Tusk Soldier or other otherworldly villain, Rick can change into a costumed superhero form or switch with one of his teammates. The player must switch to Flying Warrior form to use the characters' magic powers and defend themselves from the Tusk Soldiers' magic spells.</desc>

For years the sun seemed to shine brighter and the crops grew taller than anyone could ever remember. Surely, their troubles were far behind them, and life was one blissful long walk through paradise. But, their wonderful world would be shattered in one mighty flash from the heavens. For lightning had struck the old tombstone that lay battered and overgrown with weeds in a dark corner of the ancient cemetary. And just as fiendish life had once been given to the dead, it would be given again. First a twitch of a finger, a flutter of a heartbeat, then a powerful surge of energy to the twisted criminal brain that so long ago had terrorized the land in the powerful body of the hideous monster. The horror was about to begin again... Frankenstein had risen from the dead!</desc>

The fun will have to wait. Jason has decided to come to camp and terror is the only game they'll be playing. Only you can stop this terror. You and your six camp counselors can prevent Jason from running wild. It's not an easy task. You must first fight your way through forests filled with man-eating wolves, caves covered with blood-sucking bats, and hordes of mindless zombies at every turn. If a friend is in danger it's up to you to help... or else you can just kiss them goodbye. Jason doesn't play favorites. He'll take anyone. Don't think that hiding in a cabin or staying adrift in a canoe will keep you safe. The only way to survive this summer is to challenge Jason, face to face, and destroy him. Don't worry that it hasn't been done before... there is always a first time (well, not always).</desc>

		<name>Fun House</name>
		<desc>The general gameplay concept is that each level is like a child's version of The Running Man with a basic top-down view. Players must throw tomatoes skillfully at a series of easy-to-hit targets. Some elements of the game are indirectly taken from the classic arcade game Pole Position (except that the player does not have the option to play as a Formula One vehicle).
In order to make it to the next level, the player must make it from the starting line to the finish within the time limit with a young child on inline skates. Otherwise, the player loses a chance and the player must start the stage over again. The host of the televised game show, J. D. Roth, congratulates players for winning a stage while taunting the player with late 1980s/early 1990s sarcasm when he loses a "chance." Icy floors and slime colored ramps offer an additional challenge to the player. There are 72 rooms in the entire Fun House; with targets that are either numbered or given a generic target graphic. Each room has a name that usually gives a clue about how the room's design is implemented. Although the player is given three chances to successfully navigate the entire Fun House, collecting 25 silver coins acts as a 1-up. Warp zones will allow players to access the more difficult levels of the Fun House at an earlier time; thus allowing gamers who are pressed for time a chance to beat the game with a higher level of risk.</desc>

		<path>./Galaga.nes</path>
		<name>Galaga: Demons of Death</name>
		<desc>The objective of Galaga is to score as many points as possible by destroying insect-like enemies. The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured.
Galaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's "hit/miss ratio" at the end of the game, and a bonus "Challenging Stage" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy.
Another gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a "boss Galaga" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large.
Galaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous "Split-Screen bug" in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game "rolls over" from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.</desc>

		<desc>One day Spike O'Hara, a senior from the academic institution of Cool School High found a glowing skull in the local cemetery, a finding that would prove to be a disaster.

These ghouls from a land downunder have sort of captured your dream girl Samantha Pompom, the beautiful head cheerleader of the school. She's being held somewhere in the school and you've got to find her. (Everyone before you has failed -- but don't let that discourage you.)</desc>

		<desc>Gotcha! is an NES Zapper title based on the "sport" of paintball, and loosely tied into the paintball-themed movie caper of the same name. You are required to traverse three different battle zones, grab the opposing teams' flag from the opposite end of the field, and make it back to your flag without getting shot. One hand controls the Zapper while the other must hold the controller, since the D-Pad controls your movement up and down the field. Limited ammo is also a concern, as is the ability for the computer team to snag your flag and return it to their base to win. You can chase down and tag the flag carrier yourself to prevent this.</desc>

This gameplay style is called a tube shooter, and Gyruss is one of the very few examples that exist. The familiar scrolling starfield of earlier space shooter games was arranged to fit the 3D perspective, with the stars coming into view at the centre of the screen and flying outward, giving the impression of the player's ship moving very fast through space.</desc>

		<name>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</name>
		<desc>The plot of the NES version follows the storyline of the original movie. At the onset of the game, Jones has just reached the Pankot Palace featured in the movie and is preparing to free the slave children, recover the missing Sankara Stones and defeat Mola Ram and his Thuggee entourage. The game differs from the original arcade version in many respects, including the layout and the manner in which one progresses through the game, but the plot remains unchanged in both versions.

The player advances through 12 levels (called "waves"), the first nine of which require Jones to travel through the palace and recover the Sankara Stones. In these stages, the player may restart the game with all items intact in the last area reached. Afterwards, if the player dies, they must return to the Chamber of Kali (Wave 9) and finish the game from that point. Each level also has a timer that goes from 99 to zero. If time runs out, the player is confronted by Mola Ram and loses one life and all of their items. All levels also contain mine cart rooms, where Jones can ride the rails through the levels across hazards and past enemies.</desc>

		<desc>You're about to tee off on a course so challenging that it would've had history's greatest golfers trembling in their knickers. Handpicked by the master himself, 18 of the greatest holes in golf have now been linked together, including the 14th at St. Andrews, 18th at Muirfield, and 12th at Royal Lytham. All the elements of the major championships are here as well - the harsh winds of Scotland, the lightning fast greens of Augusta, Oakmont's death traps and the great ocean hazard at Pebble Beach. Trees are everywhere. Birdies are few. Even pin placements change from round to round, making double bogeys as common as pars. Up to a foursome can compete, or you can go it alone against a computerized Golden Bear. You also have the option of playing a skins game or stroke play.</desc>

The climax of the game mirrored the unused climax of the film, in which Grant must defeat a pair of Velociraptors by causing the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton in the Visitors Center to collapse on top of them. Grant himself is the final boss in the same location for the raptor storyline: your dinosaur character must cause the bone structure to collapse via specifically placed kicks to cause Grant to flee. A sequel was released using a new game engine and new artwork (with some of the original art as well), entitled Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. In it, Grant's helicopter (that he just escaped on in the first game) crashes. Now he must deal not only with dinosaurs, but InGen as well. A new raptor must also make it off the island.</desc>

Never in your military career have you been in such a hot spot, as the world's most threatening power, Sheik Toxic Moron, deploys his arsenal of TechnoScorch Weapons. To achieve total victory over 4 intense levels, you must possess numerous skills, including precision reflexes for air combat, a cut throat mentality for land assaults, the brains to gather secrets from underground informants, and a keen sense for surviving 3-D battle mazes. If you've got the guts to match those skills, then prepare for action. Because it'll really heat up the second you blast across the Sheik's firing line, piloting the world's most advanced super weapon - the Mach 4 Laser Invasion Helijet, which can go from hovering to a six "G" vertical climb in a heartbeat. From the moment you activate your Vulcan Cannons and Sidewinder Missiles, you'll take dead aim on an insane assault, featuring Anti-Copter Rocket Launchers, High-Altitude Bombers and Aerial Mines. But the battle's just begun, and there's no time to kill between firefights!</desc>

The basic objective of the game is to guide lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. In order to save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behavior of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles in order to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.</desc>

Then the inevitable happened: Abadon, one of the most powerful magicians, decided that has was tired of always helping the people. He figured that with a little help, he could easily take over; and so he built a massive castle, and conjured up all sorts of evil beasts to destroy the other wizards.
Now the people of Merlwood are defenseless, and Abadon's followers are running rampant. Their only hope lies in you, Paul, a young apprentice magician. Your mission will be long and difficult, filled with epic battles and magic spells. Along the way, you will meet many friends who can teach you spells and give you scrolls. But to defeat Abadon, you will need the Ultimate Potion.
Legends say that if the four vials of the elements can be brought together, the Ultimate Potion will be formed. You must seek out the vials of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, form them into the Ultimate Potion, and confront Abadon!</desc>

		<name>Millipede</name>
		<desc>The gameplay of Millipede is similar to Centipede but differs mostly in enemies:

Earwig: same as the scorpion in Centipede, making mushrooms poisonous so that the millipede will charge straight to the bottom of the screen after touching them.
Bee: same as the flea in Centipede, dropping mushrooms in a vertical line and requiring two shots to kill.
Spider: same behavior as in Centipede, bouncing irregularly across the lower portion of the screen. Multiple spiders can appear at the same time on higher levels.
Inchworm: when hit, slows all enemies for a short period of time.
Beetle: crawls around the player area for a while, then climbs up and leaves the screen, turning any mushrooms it touches into indestructible flowers. When hit, everything on the screen scrolls down one row.
Dragonfly: drops mushrooms while zigzagging down, and can be destroyed with a single shot.
Mosquito: bounces off the sides of the screen as it descends. When hit, everything on the screen scrolls up one row.
DDT bomb (stationary): can be blown up with one shot, destroying all enemies and mushrooms within the blast radius. Whenever the mushrooms scroll down, a new bomb is added at the top of the screen. Up to four bombs can be in play at one time.
All flowers and poisoned/partially destroyed mushrooms revert to normal, whole mushrooms when the player loses a life.</desc>

The journey is a difficult one though, because the castle is locked up tight and Milon doesn't have the keys. You will have to use your bubble attacks to fend off the castle baddies while busting up every block in sight trying to find all of the hidden treasure and other secrets throughout the game. Unlike most platformers, Milon's Secret Castle is less about defeating all of the enemies in an area, and more about scouring every bit of each room to find the secrets that lie within Garland Castle! Milo can uncover practically anything in the game. This includes: items, power-ups, money, shields, keys, level exits, even shops! The only way to get to each level boss is to find the right secret items!</desc>

		<desc>Need we say more?
Ultra® Dares you to defy the impossible.  But if you accept, be forewarned.  You and your trio of Impossible Mission Force agents will infiltrate a six level maze of unthinkable danger.  A fortress of international evil designed to sap every ounce of your brains and brawn.  At each turn you must fend off snipers and fire bomb maniacs.  Elude spy cameras and robot sentries.  Escape from countless enemies in hot pursuit.  All in your desperate search for booby-trapped clues, secret ID cards and life-saving switches.
  Any why?  Because the worldwide terrors known as the Sinister Seven have kidnapped Dr. "O," his nuclear military defense system and IMF agent Shannon Reed, and now they threaten to wreak planetary chaos.
  Luckly, your agents are well schooled in the art of espionage and possess their own favored firepower, from rifles to remote control cluster bombs.  But that's no guarantee you'll make it past brutes like Slash Stiletto, Blitz Blizzardski and the Iron Claw.  If by chance you do, there's always the hyper speedboat chases through Venice, hand grenade ski runs down the Swiss Alps, and prison camps in the Pyrenees mountains.
  Remember, should you choose to accept this mission and fail, you, your Nintendo®, and the world will self-destruct in five seconds.</desc>

Don't get burned on the kitchen stove or crushed by runaway golf balls. Meanwhile you'll have to punch and zap at all your fiendishly favorite monsters including the head-rolling Skeleton, the rock candy throwing Goblin, the bone-crushing Cyclops, and dozens more! Every monster you mash is worth points. Score enough and you'll get an extra life. Something you'll really need when you finally face the powerful Warlock and his magic lightning jolts.

		<desc>The shadows of doom grow long as the ancient Egyptian villain Sutekh envelops Metro City with a wave of crime. But Sutekh's seedy underworld is about to be infiltrated by a superhero unlike any the world has ever seen. A superhero who can melt into the darkness like a phantom. By day this brave new crimefighter is a common ordinary citizen. But when night falls, he is cloaked in a secret identity to seek out and destroy the dark forces that lurk on midnight streets. Who is this man the press calls Nightshade? Only you can answer that... for he is you! Every night you solidify your superhero status, patrolling 100 of the city's darkest corners. Here you'll find thieves, muggers, and other alley scum that you must either deal with or destroy for clues. But be warned. You're not the only night stalker. For as you hunt Sutekh, Sutekh hunts you with the human printing press, the closing wall of spikes, deadly jackal pits, and the chilling freeze ray.

		<desc>Ninja Hattori-kun (忍者ハットリくん?, lit. "Little Ninja Hattori") is a 1986 video game software developed and published by Hudson Soft for the Nintendo Family Computer exclusively in Japan. It is based on Fujiko Fujio A's (the pen name of Motoo Abiko) Japanese manga series of the same name, which later became an anime series and Asian franchise. The game was released around the same time the anime was aired. It was the fifth best selling Famicom game released in 1986, selling approximately 1,500,000 copies in its lifetime.

The plot begins when a young ninja name Kanzo Hattori was in search of his master in order to complete his training. While searching for his master, he encountered a young 10-year old boy name Ken (Ken'ichi) Mitsobahis and made him his temporary replacement master, in order to develop Ken's confidence, while they went on many adventures together. It was aimed at a young audience the same way as the manga and anime it is based on.</desc>

		<name>Pictionary: The Game of Video Quick Draw</name>
		<desc>The excitement of one of the America's most popular party games comes to the NES with Pictionary. Not only are the elements of the board game there, but so are several picture-based mini-games. Additionally, this version can be played solo, whereas the board game requires at least three people. 

The basic objective of Pictionary is for a person on a team to try and illustrate a word he or she has been given using only drawings. The team must guess what is being illustrated within a certain amount of time. As a reward for guessing the puzzle correctly, the team gets to advance on a board. The team that makes it to the end of the board first wins. 

In addition to the classic drawing aspect to the game, there are also four mini-games to be played in order for a team to win. These include "Attack of the Paint Zombies" (similar to Space Invaders), "The Warehouse Shuffle" (moving crates from one side of a warehouse to another as gremlins try to steal them), "Four Alarm Rescue" (catching people as they jump out of windows), and "Leapin' Energy Casules!" (capturing energy balls to fuel your spaceship). 

There are also other game modes that enable you to use cards you may have for an actual Pictionary board game or a practice mode enabling you to simply draw.</desc>

That's why plundering and pillaging are back in style, as you command the role of a high seas high-jacker. Either an English Buccaneer, Dutch Adventurer, Spanish Renegade or French Explorer, each with a different skill level and strategic impact.
As a swashbuckling scoundrel, you'll barter with enemy merchants, trade for hidden treasure maps, negotiate with unscrupulous governors and forge alliances with monarchs who'd just as soon stab you in the back than float you a loan for new ships. Buth that's only half the battle! You'll also assault towns, sword fight with garrison commanders, lay siege to forts, and fire your cannons broadside at an armada of naval foes, including Spanish War Galleons, Dutch Frigates, French Merchantment and English Sloops.
Arrrrg, me swabby! Don't think it's all fun and destruction. Because if your bloodthirsty crew isn't hept happy boarding and burning enemy vessels, or if your navigation skills leave them shipwreched on a jagged Caribbean reef, they won't think twice about using you for shark bait. Fortunately, if events do take a nasty turn, you can save the statistical foot you've captured and return with a vangeance on another day.</desc>

		<desc>Predator is a side-scrolling platformer which uses the imagery and characters from the classic Arnie movie of the same name. The game is not a faithfully conversion of the movie however - your unit has already been killed off when the game starts and you will battle scorpions, enemy soldiers and dodge obstacles etc, before facing the Predator itself a number of times.

The game is a fairly standard run-jump-shoot platformer, except that you start with no weapons at all and must collect them as the game goes on.</desc>

The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.</desc>

		<desc>The game is set on the mean streets of Brooklyn, which you must venture through to meet your girlfriend, and then rescue her from her kidnappers. This is split into five levels, taking you through the subway and the docks as well as some inhospitable streets. A wide range of aggressive moves are on offer, including headbutts, kicks, punches and flying kicks. Much of the game's violence is depicted in a fairly tongue-in-cheek style, with an element of attempted humour along the way.</desc>

		<name>Rescue: The Embassy Mission</name>
		<desc>A diplomatic mission in a foreign city is seized by political fanatics. Innocent lives are in jeopardy. Outrageous demands are being made for their safety. Only you and your elite crisis intervention team can rescue the ambassador and his helpless staff. Position your sharpshooters around the embassy's perimeter. Focus your sights on the curtained windows. Squeeze off rounds of cover fire to protect your assault squad. Once your men are inside, an electronic diagram of the building's floor plan provides your only guide down to the captives - and the awaiting enemy. Look sharp. Stay frosty. Rescue is an interactive action-adventure game that lets you control each member of your strike team through three different game scenarios. Avoid searching spotlights, dodge enemy gunfire, rappel down walls, and smash through windows. Neutralize your adversaries and liberate the embassy personnel!</desc>

However, the destruction of the vehicle will subtract a small amount from the player's fuel tank. In the arcade, Genesis and Lynx versions, players could start the game at a higher rally, with additional opportunities to jump several levels from time to time. Players can continue their game from where they left off, however the player has only one chance to complete the 50th and final rally. For completing the final rally the player gets one million points as bonus.</desc>

Then, a research team creates an unstoppable, indestructible law enforcement cyborg - named RoboCop. Using a wild assortment of weapons, including RoboCop's Special Issue Auto-9, you must stop every sleazeball criminal you encounter with deadly, piercing accuracy. But beware, there are forces on the street - and within O.C.P. - that will stop at nothing to see RoboCop eliminated. Make your way past 6 levels of street thugs, Boddicker and the powerful ED-209 to your final battle with Dick Jones. Prepare yourself for non-stop action in one of the most explosive games you will ever play. It's going to take more than a cop to clean up the scum of old Detroit - it's going to take RoboCop.

		<name>Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball</name>
		<desc>Join one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball history for Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball. While the game does not come with the license of Major League Baseball or the MLBPA, there are still 26 similar teams with rosters resembling those of their actual MLB counterparts, including 1991 statistics. Though player names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland's Bash brothers (M. Bash or J. Bash) with Texas' R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit's C. Fieldman off of Chicago's M. Gaddox. 

The gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games. Though the batting scenes may resemble those typified by R.B.I. Baseball and Major League Baseball, the view switches to what one might see from the outfield stands once the ball is hit. This results in different controls from most baseball games as well.

A player can challenge a friend or the computer, and one-player games may be exhibition or part of a 33-game season, complete with playoffs once the season is complete. In order to help make your season a successful one, Roger Clemens himself is there to offer advice.</desc>

With their greedy eyes on RollerGames' mega prize money, they've corrupted three teams and kidnapped Emerson "Skeeter" Bankhead, the games' beloved commissioner. You and your own three teams of righteous skate kings must stop V.I.P.E.R.'s criminal venom from infecting the entire city. So you've got to take the fight to the streets. And the sewers, and the junkyards, and the highways and the jungles... through 6 stages of dastardly traps of doom as you leap over open manholes, careening oil drums and treacherous landslides. Race around oil slicks and man-eating canines. And avoid ambush by combat copters, bomb-wielding goons and creeps like Captain Meat Hook and the Fish Face. But time is against you. And so are V.I.P.E.R.'s judo masters, skateboard thugs, motorcycle madmen and other assorted sinister scum. If your multi-faceted fists can't punch you through, you'll need your special assault body blocks, jump kicks and double-whammy slams. It's a bone-crunching skate-athon for your life, Skeeter's life, and for the good of RollerGames. So vanquish V.I.P.E.R. before they melt your ball-bearings into bullets!</desc>

		<desc>Based on Sesame Street, the long-running PBS children's television show, Sesame Street 123 for the NES stars Bert's best friend and roommate Ernie and the lovable blue muppet Grover. "Ernie's Magic Shapes" consists of six different magic show-themed games that help teach children colors, shapes and pattern recognition. Children are asked to match simple shapes and colors and to choose specific shapes to form things like rocket ships, wheelbarrows, and birds. Astro-Grover features five different outer space-themed games that help teach children simple arithmetic. Children can add, count and subtract little green aliens called "Zips." When a child gets an answer wrong, he or she is gently informed and allowed to try again.</desc>

		<name>Sesame Street: Big Bird's Hide &amp; Speak</name>
		<desc>Sesame Street: Big Bird's Hide and Speak is a game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was one of the simplest-to-play NES games ever released commercially. This game stars Big Bird and co-stars Little Bird, and features Bert, Ernie, The Count, Grover, and Elmo. This game was developed by RSP Inc. and published by Hi Tech Expressions. All 4 sides of the D-pad move little bird to the next window clockwise; A and B Buttons both choose a window. The center buttons (Start and Select) exit to the game select screen. The game's objective was to choose the correct character or letter, with six different levels. The first two levels are based on simply choosing the window instructed by Big Bird, while the next two needed memorizing since the windows close. In the fifth level the player had to spell the three-letter word instructed by choosing the right letters and the last level the player must attempt to spell the most number of different words before a time limit, the letters in the windows changing after a new word is created.</desc>

You can choose between different difficulty levels. They affect the time you have to complete the stages. For difficulty level 1 you get 300 game time, difficulty level 2 gives you 250 and the 3rd difficulty level only 200. Items you can shoot during the game include an hourglass which extends time by 50, an E which gives you 100 points + 1 Energy bar, an E in a white square which gives you 100 points + 2 Energy bars, a Reverse E which gives you 1 Energy bar and C or W symbol which both give only 100 points each. Each disc you shoot above an enemy is worth between 100-500 points. The game contains three stages that involve a western, ghost house, and a space theme. There is also a bonus stage where you try to shoot as many bottles as possible. In the party game mode, you compete to have the highest score.</desc>

Their assignment and yours is to command the G-Cobra attack helicopter and the B-Panther interceptor jeep to combat and destroy the MHC2, an artificial brain of the future which has taken over the military forces and weapons of the world's population and forcing them to worship him as a god.

This exciting game features simultaneous two player interaction and challenges you to master the controls of two uniquely individual vehicles, the B-Panther jeep and the G-cobra helicopter. Join the Silkworm team! Take on the challenge of MHC2 and the military firepower of the world!

Silkworm also spawned what many consider to be a spiritual successor to the game - SWIV.  While SWIV was not a direct sequel, it followed the same core gameplay design of a helicopter/jeep team, albeit as a vertically scrolling shooter instead of a horizontally scrolling one. SWIV was described in the game's manual to mean both "Special Weapons Intercept Vehicles" and "Silkworm IV".</desc>

Silver Surfer learns that creatures from the Magick Dimension are trying to break through into the universe and their coming will end all life. Vowing to stop them, Silver Surfer must assemble the pieces of a mysterious Cosmic Device and use it to push them back. The pieces of the Device are currently in the hands of some malicious creatures: Reptyl, Mephisto, Skrull Emperor, Possessor and Firelord. Silver Surfer must travel to their domains and defeat them in order to obtain pieces of the device.

Silver Surfer is a shooter game, with some levels taking place vertically and some horizontally. The Surfer's only ability is to move around on the screen and to shoot directly in front of him. Power-ups that can be picked up include: the letter "F" (Firepower) which will increase the number and power of his projectiles, Smart bombs which destroy everything on the screen, the letter "S" (Speedup) which increases the surfer's movement and Orbs which will also fire the Surfer's weapon. Orbs are special in that two can be obtained (only 1 is shown on horizontal scrolling levels) and they can be positioned to fire forwards, backwards or sideways.</desc>

		<name>Space Shuttle Project</name>
		<desc>The object of this video game is to successfully launch and fly one of NASA's historic Space Shuttles. Gameplay is composed of several different types of missions, each broken up into short mini-games.
The first part of the game requires the player to activate oxygen and hydrogen pumps as well as get additional crew members into the shuttle within a strict time limit by moving an elevator up and down and avoiding moving bumpers. Then, the player must successfully launch the shuttle into space by performing quick time events that correspond to particular shuttle launch maneuvers such as booster rocket separation. Once in space, one of several missions will be played where the player must control the astronaut by maneuvering him around hazards, replenish his air supply before the timer runs out, and deliver components for the International Space Station to their correct locations. A cosmonaut from the Soviet Union must also be rescued in the game.
Finally, the player must land the shuttle by again performing Quick Time Events that correspond to landing maneuvers before finally landing at Edwards Air Force Base.</desc>

		<desc>The video game takes place in the "deepest and darkest" part of Africa during the year 1871. Nations were sending their explorers to uncover the last remaining continent that was not fully mapped by the European superpowers. Dr. Livingston abandoned his original quest to uncover the temple of Am-Zutuk; who was worshipped as a god amongst the indigenous African people. The player, as reporter Henry Morton Stanley (after Sir Stanley, 1841-1904), is exploring the last of the mysterious jungle regions for European colonization when his professor, Dr. Livingston (patterned after Dr. David Livingstone, with an ending "e"), gets kidnapped by some African tribesmen. Now, the player must explore one of the last uncharted parts of Africa to save his mentor and end an era of exploring Africa. The player is automatically equipped with an gyrocopter to make those tricky landings much smoother.</desc>

Fuel stations are placed around sporadically and help if fuel is running low. There are several different planets that are either empty or have people that can upgrade the player's equipment to fight off the enemy fleets. These upgrades include the super laser, improved shields, and engines that enhance the ship's warping ability. Warping is a vital part of the gameplay. If players do not warp to different sectors wisely, they might end up lost, run into dangerous sectors such as the black hole or the asteroid field, or run out of fuel. The game ends if enemy ships destroy the CosmoStation Noah.</desc>

		<desc>Super Mario Bros. 3Mix is a ROM hack of Super Mario Bros. 3 by Captain Southbird (or just Southbird, as on the title screen) that pays tribute to the Mario series as a whole. Among the features are:
• Overworlds and levels not found in Super Mario Bros. 3 (often directly based on ones from other Mario games).
• Added music (again, generally from other Mario games).
• New power-ups (or rather, ones that weren't originally in Super Mario Bros. 3).
• Added game mechanics, such as checkpoints and a functional Yoshi (who works as in Super Mario World).
• A save feature that can be accessed by pausing (either during a level or on the overworld), featuring the ability to save all current progress.
• Three playable characters (Mario, Luigi, and Toad). There are no gameplay differences, but there is a two-player mode, unlike some other hacks.</desc>

The game utilizes the Nintendo Power Pad; to control your on screen character you will need to run in place on the Power Pad to make your character run, and actually jump to make him jump. In the basic game you need to run and jump your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race. Several cooperative games are included as well, including a tug of war, relay race, and six legged race.</desc>

		<desc>Yo! After being treated like garbage by the Ninja Turtles, Shredder has trained a new, more merciless breed of Foot Soldiers to inflict his revenge: A clan of over 700 Taekwondo turtle terminators who have once again captured April O'Neil to use as turtle bait. Fortunately you don't have to face these freaks of torture alone. For the first time ever, two dudes or dudettes can join forces and double-team Shredder, kicking shell while covering each others tails.

But to survive you've gotta fight through 8 action-packed arcade levels, including Vinnie's Valet "Stalking" Lot and the Soho Sewer System, plus two new never-before-seen shell-squashing stages! Each of these deathtraps is reinforced by lethal electro zappers, laser beams, freezer burners or enemies such as Scorpion Robots, Stone Warriors and Baxter Stockman. Shredder has also hired the all-powerful Tora and Shogun, two alien bounty hunters who have never known defeat.

Even though Master Splinter has prepared the turtles well for battle, teaching them radical new attack moves, it doesn't mean this war to save April and turtlekind will be a piece of cake or even a slice of pizza. Because with the forces of revenge on his side and the bounty boys in town, it's payback time for Shredder!</desc>

		<name>Tetris (Tengen)</name>
		<desc>The drama surrounding Tetris is one of the most storied sagas in the history of the NES. Tengen, an ambitious Atari-associated game developer, began releasing official NES games in 1988. Meanwhile, the company worked rapidly behind the scenes to override Nintendo's infamous lockout device that kept unofficial cartridges from being played on its console. When Tengen released its first unofficial games using its new technology, Nintendo quickly sued. This was just the beginning of the Tengen/Nintendo feud. Ignoring Nintendo's claim to the Tetris name in the US a year later, Tengen released its own version of the world's most famous puzzle game on an unlocked, unofficial cartridge. Tengen's tetris was pulled from shelves almost immediately when it was revealed that Nintendo's hold on the Tetris name stateside was legitimate. Unfortunately, almost everyone agrees that Tengen's version of the game was far superior to Nintendo's, even including a two-player mode which Nintendo's version sorely lacked. Today, the game known as Tengen Tetris is a rare title to have in your collection, but it's a worthwhile play. After all, Tetris is one of the classic games not only on the NES, but of all-time.</desc>

		<name>The 3-D Battles of WorldRunner</name>
		<desc>The 3-D Battles of WorldRunner (shortened to 3-D WorldRunner on the North American box art),[1] originally released in Japan as Tobidase Daisakusen (とびだせ大作戦 lit. 'Operation: Jump Out'?), is a 1987 third-person rail shooter platform video game developed and published by Square for the Family Computer Disk System and published by Acclaim for the Nintendo Entertainment System itself.[2]

In the game, the player assumes the role of Jack the WorldRunner, a wild "space cowboy" on a mission to save various planets overrun by serpent-like beasts.[3] The game takes place in Solar System #517, which is being overrun by a race of aliens known as Serpentbeasts, who are led by the evil Grax.[4] As WorldRunner, the player must battle through eight planets to destroy Grax. For its time, the game was technically advanced; the game's three-dimensional scrolling effect is very similar to the linescroll effects used by Pole Position and many racing games of the day as well as the forward-scrolling effect of Sega's 1985 third-person rail shooter Space Harrier.[5] 3-D WorldRunner was an early forward-scrolling pseudo-3D third-person platform-action game where players were free to move in any forward-scrolling direction and had to leap over obstacles and chasms. It was also notable for being one of the first stereoscopic 3-D games.</desc>

		<desc>When nightmares come to life... You discover you're not immortal! You're a mighty wizard in search of your lost master, Mordamir. Venture into the dungeon and slove the mysteries of each level. Unravel the secrets of The Immortal!

The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.

Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of isometric death await.

The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards.</desc>

But don't think that just being able to fight will get you through. This time it's not enough to just punch, kick and jump... this time your total martial arts training will be put to the test. Your discipline and inner control could be what saves your life. You must prove that you are capable of thinking, reasoning, and reacting. Catching a fly with your chopsticks or splitting blocks of ice with your bare hand is just as important as fighting face to face with your enemy. This challenge will take you to the streets of L.A., the back roads of Okinawa and many strange areas beyond. Always keep your mind clear and remember all that you've been taught, and maybe... just maybe... you'll make it!</desc>

		<desc>In Tiles Of Fate the object of the game is to clear the screen of all the tiles within the given time limit. This is done by selecting two tiles with matching symbols which will cause them to disappear due to the force of symmetry. However, the force of symmetry can only make two right angles at most, and can not pass through other tiles. To clear all the tiles, you will need to plan your moves carefully. To help out, you may discover one of three forces of fate under a tile which can be saved and used when you're stuck. The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.) Also included is a level editor which lets you create your own tile challenges.</desc>

Gameplay consists of moving the protagonist in real-time (day and night) through various terrains, like forests, towns, and dungeons. The player character gathers basic items, like health and magic potions, and increasingly powerful weapons as he completes tasks and advances the plot. Conversations are handled through key phrases. Battles involve a few types of creatures (skeletons, orcs, rogues) of which there can be various flavors.</desc>

		<desc>There is a new amusement park in Acme Acres, and everyone has been invited to visit by a "Secret Admirer".
There are five areas which the player can explore, each one starring a different character. Plucky rides a bumper car. Hamton rides a tricky train trip. Babs rides the rollercoaster. Furrball dodges Sweetie as he goes for a wild log ride. And Buster faces the thrills and chills of the Funhouse.
Each ride costs a certain amount of tickets, but as the player racks up points on the various rides, more tickets are earned. Eventually, when enough tickets have been earned, they can be saved until the player has enough to afford the entrance fee to the Funhouse, where Buster Bunny must then navigate numerous obstacles before squaring off with the "Secret Admirer", who turns out to be Montana Max.
Just like in the first game, Roderick Rat is there to try to interfere, plus other villain characters. Other Tiny Toon characters also make appearances in varying degrees.</desc>

You will need to pilot your ship, The Tempest, to the planets Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Earth in order to retrieve certain minerals which can be used to fight the Raggosians. The Raggosians will be trying to stop you from reaching these destinations, though, so you need to use the Nintendo zapper to fight back. Numerous (and very fast!) enemy ships will fly by on the screen and attempt to destroy your ship. You need to shoot the ships and incoming missiles before your ship takes too much damage. From time to time a comet will fly by, and if you shoot this a temporary barrier will be formed that protects your ship from enemy fire. Occasionally you can also earn a smart bomb which appears in the bottom of the screen and destroys all enemies if shot. Each level ends with a large boss which will take multiple hits to destroy.</desc>

It features elements of tongue-in-cheek humor combined with the action. The player takes control of an enchanted ape who must battle hordes of jungle monsters with energy balls from his mouth (described humorously as "monkey-spit" or "monkey-vomit" by some gamers). The ultimate goal is to destroy the evil wizard who cast a spell on you; therefore transforming yourself from an ape back into a human, and rescuing the kidnapped princess. The game was ported to several video game consoles and home computers.</desc>

You'll witness the greatest inventions of all time: fire, the wheel, the pogo stick (the pogo stick?) - all invented by Trog to catch his dinner - you! Just watch out for the Tar Pits... sticky business. You've got special pick-ups to keep that carnivorous chow hound in check, like pineapples that turn you into a ferocious Trog-munching T-Rex. It's like this: either you save the Dinos... or you're extinct!</desc>

Occasionally, you may find hostages when a building is destroyed; try to rescue as many of the hostages as you can to earn extra points. Your helicopter has the ability to pick up extra weapons. After destroying certain enemies, a power up will be left behind which can give you one of four different types of firepower (the regular machine gun, canon, two way fire, or missiles). Other power ups that can be found include bombs (which can be used to destroy everything on the screen), extra speed, and weapon power up (increases the capabilities of whatever type of weapon you currently have).</desc>

Lord British, the country's benevolent monarch, has disappeared, and a man named Blackthorn has usurped his throne. The tyrant rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. His fundamentalist visions led him to create a police state, where failure to adhere to the virtues is punishable by death. Behind Blackthorn are the three Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Avatar must understand their meaning and origins, find a way to defeat them, rescue Lord British, and restore the former ethical principles of Britannia.</desc>

Except for these Weasels (and birds flying overhead), Roger is more or less invincible as a toon. That means for most of the gameplay, he will be ignored. Should the Weasels appear in an area with you however (with an alarm sounding as they get close), Roger will go bug-eyed and try to run away. It is then up to Eddie to keep the Weasels away from Roger or engage in knock-knock jokes should they happen to catch him.</desc>

		<name>Zen: Intergalactic Ninja</name>
		<desc>IF YOU LIKE FIGHTING DIRTY, YOU'RE GONNA DIG ZEN!

The greatest environmental disaster in human history is about to hit your backyard. But you're not backing down, because you're Zen, a cold-blooded Ninja warrior who's come to Earth to clean the clock of Lord Contaminous and his crud-loving cronies.

But wasting these slimeballs won't be easy. Because they'll spew forth the most hazardous graphics ever to wreak havoc on your NES. We're talking horizontal, vertical and 3/4 view scrolling that will give you a whole new perspective on acid rain, oil spills and ozone-ravaging smog. And wait till you see the fluid character movements. They're hotter than a uranium-oozing nuclear meltdown!

There are 12 total levels, each with its own ecological enemies, toxic traps and pollution-fighting objectives. You'll battle oil rig fires, trying to save trapped workers. Use your Photon-Stick to zap gaseous garbage men on a high-speed plutonium mining car ride. Vertical jump through two separate screens to reach a venomous vixen who's single-handedly scorching the rainforests. And spin kick Smogger, a smoked-out scum of the Earth.

Finally, try to survive a rescue mission stage. Rack up points in the bonus recycling level. And slash through 6 subgames that will lead you to the feet of Lord Contaminous, who you must dispose of before he trashes every living thing on the face of the Earth.

For 1 Ninja Master.</desc>

		<desc>1999. What appeared to be a harmless meteorite crashing in the Nevada desert has turned out to be Darc Seed, an evil alien creature with horrible powers. By shooting strange magnetic rays, Darc Seed had turned the helpless nation into zombies and had brought the Statue of Liberty to life to do his dirty work. These rays had also given him control over many deadly weapons, but none were more powerful than the legendary samurai sword, Shura. When the great head of the samurai, Namakubi, heard that the sword had fallen into evil hands, he set off immediately for the United States. For only he possessed the strength and knowledge needed to recapture the magical sword and free the U.S. from the evil clutches of Darc Seed.</desc>
