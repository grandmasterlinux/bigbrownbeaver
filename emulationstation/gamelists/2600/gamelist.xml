Adventure allowed the player to drop one item and pick up another without having to type in any commands. The graphics, on the other hand, were not that great, and Robinett even described the dragons as looking like ducks.</desc>

		<desc>Adventures of TRON is based on the motion picture TRON from Walt Disney Productions.

The game environment consists of 4 floors, each with flying "bits" as well as enemy MCP attackers. The objective of the game is to control TRON (you) in a maze of platforms and elevators while trying to intercept the flying bits (intercepting bits on higher floors are awarded higher points).

Dodge enemy MCP attackers by jumping, using elevators and hitching a ride on the Silver Sailor. Capturing all 7 "bits" will take you to the next level, with added speed and difficulty.</desc>

		<desc>The object of this game is to defend the buildings at the bottom of the screen.

There are four types of attacking ships moving down the screen. You are moving just above the buildings. The enemies are dropping bombs to try to damage your buildings or destroy you. You must fire missiles up to destroy them. The waves of enemies never ends.

The game ends when all three of your ships are destroyed or when both buildings have taken so much damage that they collapse.

There are eight game variations. Some where the ships move side-to-side while moving down, some where your shots move to the side when you do, some faster and some with combinations of any or all of these.</desc>

Each floor has two hatch keys that need to be collected in order to unlock the elevator to the next level. There is a time limit, though; if you take too long the floor will flood and you'll be unable to escape. Due to the crash, the torpedoes on board the submarine are now loose and wander across the floor as the boat shakes. The player will need to jump over any torpedoes that cross their path, or they will be stunned momentarily and lose precious time.</desc>

After you clear one level, you get a bonus game. You have to move up the screen to the prize at the top past several aliens, reminiscent of Freeway. You do not lose a man if you fail but you only have eight seconds to do it then you are off the the next, harder level.</desc>

		<desc>Classical Atari 2600 game! In Asteroid Belt you are flying - guess what -  through an asteroid belt. Typical for Atari is the lack of and ending, so you´re shooting asteroids for points. You can fly and also shoot in four different directions and even control your speed. Sometimes there is a giant UFO trying to catch and kill you, so the fast speed is comming in handy, although you have to avoid the asteroids and flee from the giant UFO. 

This is one of the few non-popular Atari games amongst the universe of Atari Space-games that is really good.</desc>

The player controls a triangular-shaped ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. As the ship moves, momentum is not conserved — the ship eventually comes to a stop again when not thrusting. The player can also send their ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen (with the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid).</desc>

BASIC is an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. In conjunction with the manual, this cartridge will help you learn the beginning steps of this easy-to-learn computer language. You can create simple programs, games, and even compose your own music. Up to nine lines of code are allowed.

To simplify the input of data, BASIC Programming requires a set of special keyboard controllers that plug into both the left and right joystick ports. These keyboard controllers were included in the original packaging.</desc>

that has been passed down from generation-to-generation as part of the culture's oral
tradition.

The object of the game is to eat 'em every time he beats 'em. You score one point for
each and every drop you swallow without a miss. But should you miss, shame on you. You lose one turn. After all, it could have been a famous doctor or lawyer.

You have four turns at the outset of the game. Small squares in the lower left-hand
corner of the screen indicate the remaining number of turns at any point in the game.

You can earn "bonus turns" for every "69" points you score; however, you may
accumulate no more than 6 turns plus the one in play at any given time.</desc>

		<name>Blueprint</name>
		<desc>As in the arcade game of the same name, Blueprint gives you, as J.J., three chances to save the damsel in distress from a menacing creature chasing her across the top of the screen. Navigate J.J. through a maze of houses, which contain either a piece of the Rube-Goldberg-esque monster-fighting contraption whose blueprint lies at the bottom of the screen, or a bomb which must be disposed of in short order. Pressing the button will make J.J. run faster, but like so many who spend a lot of time sitting at the Atari 2600, he has a limited amount of "Fast run time" (as indicated by a handy bar graph). Smaller but still pesky monsters also pop out of the bomb disposal pit and try to prematurely start the machine (which shakes it to bits). Once that occurs, those monsters must be lured back to their pit, and the machine must be reassembled. Build the machine in time, and you can blast the creature who's chasing your girlfriend. The Atari 2600 edition simplifies the graphics drastically (though the most elaborate part of the playing field -- the blueprint itself -- is more or less intact), and drops the sound effects back to bare minimum (so much for the game's catchy little jazzy background tunes). There are no control issues, however, and the end result is still quite colorful and a lot of fun.</desc>

There are 16 levels of increasing difficulty - each with four rounds of challenging space combat.  Before you meet the MOTHER SHIP, your pilot skills and nerve are tested against deadly ELECTRON POSTS, ALIEN SAUCERS and smashing SPACE HOPPERS.  This is a battle of speed, accuracy and endurance.  Your time consumption is crucial to your survival.  

If you deplete your time you lose one of your five fighter ships.  The faster you fly, the sooner you'll get to the MOTHER SHIP, allowing yourself more time to destroy it.  You begin with a full time line when you destroy the MOTHER SHIP.  

Be aggressive but don't be reckless.  This is do or die cosmic combat and it's the MOTHER SHIP or YOU!</desc>

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.</desc>

		<desc>CANYON BOMBER GAMES

GAME 1: Canyon Bomber (One-Player)
Test your skill against the computer.  It's not an easy task.  You've got six misses in which to match wits with the computer for a higher score.  Each time the bricks in the canyon are hit, the remaining bricks "fall" to a lower level (rather than remaining stationary in their original position).  Bricks that fall to a lower level are worth the points designated for that level.

Keep an eye on the solid bar beneath your score on the upper right side of the screen.  It is a "miss indicator" and gradually decreases in length each time you miss until six misses are recorded and the game ends.  The bar is also color-coordinated with your planes and your score.

Set your sights for 1000 points.  Although the game will not end if you reach the 1000 point mark, it's an excellent goal to set for yourself since it will be very difficult to obtain.

GAME 2: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)
This game differs from Game 1 only in that you are competing against another player rather than the computer.  Play ends when six misses are recorded against both players.  the player with the highest score wins. 

Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponent's "miss indicator" as well as your own.  Bombs away!

GAME 3: Canyon Bomber (One-Player)
This one's the same as Game 1 with one exception.  Rather than falling to a lower level, the bricks in the canyon stay "suspended" in their original position when the surrounding bricks are hit.

GAME 4: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)
You compete with another player the same as in Game 2.  This time however, the brick remain suspended instead of falling to a lower level.

GAME 5: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)
Get set for a test of your endurance and concentration.  The first player to score 1000 points wins.  No time limit and no limit to the number of bombs or misses.  Falling, rather than suspended bricks are programed into this game.

No "miss indicator" will appear on the screen in games with unlimited bombs.

GAME 6: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)
This game program is identical to Game 5, except that the bricks stay suspended.


SEA BOMBER GAMES

GAME 7: Sea Bomber (One-Player)
You're playing against the computer.  Set the level, release the bomb, and boom, you're ready for action.  Sounds easy, but the computer's a real steady competitor.  If you score 1000 points before the computer does, you're a winner!

GAME 8: Sea Bomber (Two-Player)
This time you're competing against another player in a race to the 1000 point mark.</desc>

		<desc>Okay, soccer fans, the ATARI CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER ™ Team challenges you to a game. The ATARI computer team is waiting impatiently inside your Game Program cartridge for you to select one of the single player games (Games 28 through 54). They want to show you their stuff. Here’s a brief rundown on each player, just so you’ll know who you’re up against.

"CRASH" MORGAN, the galloping goalie, is the fastest man on the team. "CRASH" got his nickname because he is forever slamming into the goal posts chasing after the ball. Fortunately, the goal posts are never damaged, but sometimes you can score a goal on him before his ears stop ringing.

NICK DANGER, the frantic forward, is mean and nasty and just loves to blast the ball into your goal shouting, "eat leather, chump." Don’t let his bad manners bother you, it’s just his way of rattling the opposition.

"LUMPY" DURAN, the left back, is without a doubt the clumsiest player in the world of soccer. Penalized twice for stepping on the ball instead of kicking it, he was finally thrown out of one game for toe-kicking the referee!

ALEXIE PUTSNOWSKI (Putsy), the right back. What can we say about Putsy? A real ladies man, a great soccer player, a sore loser. Even though "The Puts" has kicked and gouged his way to soccer stardom, for three years in a row he has been voted the "least likely" player.</desc>

It was later sold as Kung Fu Superkicks when the license for the use of the name Chuck Norris expired.  The game was produced for the Commodore 64, Commodore VIC-20, Atari 2600, and Colecovision as part of Xonox's double-ender cartridge line (cartridges with two games and two connectors that were flipped over depending on which one the user wanted to play).

The player is a martial arts expert that has to liberate a hostage. The game combines two types of game-play: moving through a map, and fighting against enemies.</desc>

First the troop carrying helicopters fly in dropping android paratroopers to test your defenses. Soon the sky is filled with fluttering helicopters and wave after wave of android paratroopers. They must be destroyed! Each paratrooper allowed to land on a building destroys a portion of that building. If three paratroopers land on a building. It will be totally destroyed and must be considered under commando control.

Worse still, the androids can now tunnel towards your gun emplacement. Each paratrooper who lands on that building expands the tunnel. If they are not stopped, they will plant an explosive charge under the gun.

In the midst of the battle, an aircraft may appear. It will drop a devastating bomb which can destroy all buildings and the gun emplacement. You must shoot it down or at least shoot the bomb it drops. If you miss, its back to basic training!</desc>

You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:

-Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.
-Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.
-Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.
-Electrical "Nichibutsu" signs with a dangling live wire.

		<name>Desert Falcon</name>
		<desc>Desert Falcon is an arcade style shooter. Many of the Pharaoh's great treasures are lost throughout the desert, and your goal is to steal as many as you can to earn points. The game features a scrolling, isometric point of view as you control your falcon through the various desert landscapes. The treasures you are after are guarded of course. Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue on. Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.</desc>

		<desc>You control a race car on a four lane track, and your goal is to collect all of the dots in order to earn points and advance to the next level! The race track is broken up into four quadrants; your racecar must remain in the lane it is in except where there is a break in the lanes between quadrants. Trying to stop you is a second car which travels in the opposite direction. This car will always be trying to get into the same lane as you, causing a crash, so you need to make sure you switch to any lane it isn't in! To help out, your racecar has the ability to travel at a fast or slow speed. You begin the game with three racecars, and the game ends when all three cars have crashed. A two player game variation is also available where one player controls a car trying to collect the dots, and the second player controls the crash car trying to stop the first player.</desc>

		<path>./Dolphin.bin</path>
		<name>Dolphin</name>
		<desc>Listen!  An endangered dolphin is calling you!  Only by learning the dolphin's sonic language can you guide her through schools of seahorses, battling a monstrous squid, to gain magic powers from and elusive seagull.  Hurry!  Lend an ear...

You will guide your dolphin through openings in the seahorse schools by listening to sonic tones and catching waves. Pay attention to the following:

THE SEAGULL:  
Periodically, a seagull will fly overhead.  You'll know he's coming when the squid changes color.  Have your dolphin leap up, touch the seagull and then quickly turn and chase the squid.  This is the best way to gain points.  Also, the game resets at the next difficulty level putting distance between your dolphin and the squid.

THE SLIP:  
Another great way to outsmart the squid is by giving him "the slip".  If the squid is right on your tail, wait until he catches a good wave.  Then, reverse your dolphin's direction and swim under him immediately.  As long as the squid's good wave remains on the screen, he won't be able to reverse and catch you.

SCORING:  
Points are earned in a variety of ways.  Every time your dolphin touches a seagull, or a squid, you score points.  The number of points depends on the color of the squid. Scoring peaks at 800 per seagull and 8000 per squid.

Also, you'll score 100 points each time your dolphin catches a good wave or each time you run the squid into a bad wave.  And, when your dolphin swims through the seahorses, you'll score 0 to 50 points, depending on your degree of accuracy in getting her through the opening.</desc>

The goal of Dragonfire is to avoid the dragon's fireballs and capture the king's treasure. In the first screen, you run across a bridge, ducking and jumping over fireballs. Then, in the treasure room, you pick up the various treasures, avoiding the dragon's fireballs, and leave through the door you came in. Then you start again. Although Dragonfire is a novel game, it gets boring pretty quickly.</desc>

Even though Dumbo was developed as a children's game, the gameplay is quite difficult which may be the reason why it was never released.</desc>

		<desc>TEST PILOT LOG MARCH 17, 2093:  On what started to be the routine high speed test of interplanetary craft Delta 12, a power plant malfunction caused the craft to skip off the rim of a small, black hole.  After experiencing level 5 turbulence I became unconscious.  Upon awaking, I found myself in a time and place unknown to me;  the craft having been completely destroyed.

The place I am in is inhabited by giant bug-like creatures.  Through thought waves, the inhabitants explained that they are part of a culture originally insect-like but now almost entirely mechanical.  As their biological body parts began to age beyond effective use they replaced them with mechanical parts.  Through their will to survive they eventually crated an entire society composed of machines.

During this gradual conversion from living matter to machinery a group of the inhabitants started programming themselves to survive even at the expense of others in the society.  They became know as the Bad-Bugs.  After the complete metamorphosis to computer controlled minds these bugs began attacking the good creatures.

Because of my human reasoning and ability as an experienced test pilot the good bugs have asked for my help.  I have been put in command of the best machine-bug on their planet.  My task of saving the good bugs should prove extremely difficult since the Bad-Bugs have creature-machines programmed solely for the purpose of stopping me.  I will, however, be awarded valuable treasures by the good bugs for every enemy I eliminate.  

To further complicate my task the good bugs have asked me to rescue the last remaining living creature on their planet, the Pixie.  They have warned me to be very cautious when approaching the Pixy since it is constantly guarded by a killer, machine-bee.</desc>

		<desc>TEST PILOT LOG MARCH 17, 2093:  On what started to be the routine high speed test of interplanetary craft Delta 12, a power plant malfunction caused the craft to skip off the rim of a small, black hole.  After experiencing level 5 turbulence I became unconscious.  Upon awaking, I found myself in a time and place unknown to me;  the craft having been completely destroyed.

The place I am in is inhabited by giant bug-like creatures.  Through thought waves, the inhabitants explained that they are part of a culture originally insect-like but now almost entirely mechanical.  As their biological body parts began to age beyond effective use they replaced them with mechanical parts.  Through their will to survive they eventually crated an entire society composed of machines.

During this gradual conversion from living matter to machinery a group of the inhabitants started programming themselves to survive even at the expense of others in the society.  They became know as the Bad-Bugs.  After the complete metamorphosis to computer controlled minds these bugs began attacking the good creatures.

Because of my human reasoning and ability as an experienced test pilot the good bugs have asked for my help.  I have been put in command of the best machine-bug on their planet.  My task of saving the good bugs should prove extremely difficult since the Bad-Bugs have creature-machines programmed solely for the purpose of stopping me.  I will, however, be awarded valuable treasures by the good bugs for every enemy I eliminate.  

To further complicate my task the good bugs have asked me to rescue the last remaining living creature on their planet, the Pixie.  They have warned me to be very cautious when approaching the Pixy since it is constantly guarded by a killer, machine-bee.</desc>

		<desc>In the cold dark night you make your way through the ghoulish castle of Dr. Frankenstein. There you must prevent him from completing his creation.

Your only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you must build a barricade around the monster before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive.

You start at the top floor of the castle and must make your way to the dungeon to get a stone to wall in the monster, all the while avoiding ghosts, giant tarantulas, trapdoors, spiders and a pool of acid. Once you have the stone, you must make your way back to the top, again avoiding these obstacles. When you get near the monster, you switch to a new screen where you must make your way past bats to place the stone. You must do this four times and each time gets harder, with more ghosts, more and bigger tarantulas, and a harder to cross acid pool.

You have three lives and falling into the acid pool will lose you one. You are also timed (see Difficulty settings) and you are trying to get and not lose points</desc>

		<desc>Front Line (フロントライン Furonto Rain?) is a military-themed run &amp; gun shooter game released by Taito for arcades in 1982. It was one of the first video games to feature a ground combat theme and grenades.[citation needed] Military-oriented video games of the early 1980s usually involved vehicular combat, such as tanks, but did not include infantry. The original arcade version of Front Line consists of a joystick, a single button, and a rotary dial that can be pushed in like a button, which fires the weapon. The single button is used to throw grenades, and to enter and exit the tank.

1985's Ikari Warriors follows the conventions established by Front Line, including the vertically scrolling levels, entering/exiting tanks, and not dying when an occupied tank is destroyed.</desc>

		<name>G.I. Joe: Cobra Strike</name>
		<desc>In the single-player mode, the player controls a G.I. Joe training camp on the bottom of the screen protected by a barrier and armed with two laser cannons. In this mode the goal is to keep the giant Cobra-operated robot snake from destroying the shield and thus the training camp by hitting it eight times. The Cobra robot shoots venom and laser beams.
In two-player cooperative mode control of the G.I. Joe training game is split between two players as they work to destroy the Cobra robot. In the two-player competition mode one player controls the Cobra robot and another player controls the training camp.
Cobra Strike was the first video game to use the G.I. Joe license. The U.K. version of the game was renamed Action Man: Action Force.

Synopsis:
"The Action Force training camp is under siege from a giant Cobra Combat Machine built by the evil Baron Ironblood. As the Cobra looms over the camp the Action Force recruits run to shelter from its vaporizing venom and piercing laser beams. Man your positions! Defend the camp! Use missile attack cannons and atomic-powered energy shields to fight the deadly Cobra."</desc>

Grand Prix was the first Atari 2600 game to feature shaded objects in color. When David Crane developed an Atari 2600 programming technique for painting large, multicolored sprites on the screen, he made a color pattern that reminded him of Grand Prix racing stripes. This inspired him to design a Grand Prix racing game to apply his new technique.</desc>

		<desc>The evil being called Gravitar is out attempting to destroy the universe! With each galaxy he conquers he leaves behind extreme gravitational forces, a powerful, explosive reactor and deadly bunkers. Your job is to stop Gravitar by taking back the twelve solar systems located in four galaxies that are under his control! In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the next galaxy which will be even more difficult to save. The game includes five different skill levels which vary in difficulty by supplying different amounts of ships to begin the game as well as different strengths of gravity.</desc>

		<name>Halo 2600</name>
		<desc>The year is 2552. Planet Earth still exists, but overpopulation has forced many of her former residents to colonize other worlds. After contact with an outer colony was lost, a battlegroup was sent to investigate and was almost completely destroyed; only one badly damaged ship returned to tell of a seemingly unstoppable alien warship that had effortlessly annihilated their forces.

This was humankind's first encounter with a group of aliens they eventually came to know as the Covenant, a collective of alien races bent on wiping out humanity. A desperate plan is set in motion: board a Covenant vessel and learn the location of the Covenant home world. But before the mission begins, Covenant forces strike and annihilate the attack force.

 
The Covenant are now on Earth's doorstep. One ship escapes and makes a blind jump into deep space, hoping to lead the Covenant away from Earth. The ship crashes on Halo--an artificial ring world that is actually a weapon capable of destroying all life in the galaxy should it fall into the hands of the Covenant.

You are the Master Chief--all that remains of a classified military project to build a series of genetically enhanced super- soldiers. You are humanity's last and best hope against the Covenant--but you're woefully out-matched, and survival is not guaranteed. Can you battle your way through the massive world that is Halo, defeat the Covenant, and save humanity?

Halo 2600 is an original homebrew game created by Ed Fries for the Atari 2600. Ed Fries once worked as the VP of Game Publishing for Microsoft's Xbox division and was instrumental in bringing Bungie Studios into the Microsoft studio family). AtariAge worked with Ed Fries to produce Halo 2600 in physical cartridge form, and a limited run was produced for the 2010 Classic Gaming Expo. After the Classic Gaming Expo, additional cartridges were produced using a different label to differentiate the two releases.

In the game, Halo players control Master Chief in a non-scrolling exploration game with rooms to explore and a variety of enemies to shoot.

		<name>Halo 2600</name>
		<desc>The year is 2552. Planet Earth still exists, but overpopulation has forced many of her former residents to colonize other worlds. After contact with an outer colony was lost, a battlegroup was sent to investigate and was almost completely destroyed; only one badly damaged ship returned to tell of a seemingly unstoppable alien warship that had effortlessly annihilated their forces.

This was humankind's first encounter with a group of aliens they eventually came to know as the Covenant, a collective of alien races bent on wiping out humanity. A desperate plan is set in motion: board a Covenant vessel and learn the location of the Covenant home world. But before the mission begins, Covenant forces strike and annihilate the attack force.

 
The Covenant are now on Earth's doorstep. One ship escapes and makes a blind jump into deep space, hoping to lead the Covenant away from Earth. The ship crashes on Halo--an artificial ring world that is actually a weapon capable of destroying all life in the galaxy should it fall into the hands of the Covenant.

You are the Master Chief--all that remains of a classified military project to build a series of genetically enhanced super- soldiers. You are humanity's last and best hope against the Covenant--but you're woefully out-matched, and survival is not guaranteed. Can you battle your way through the massive world that is Halo, defeat the Covenant, and save humanity?

Halo 2600 is an original homebrew game created by Ed Fries for the Atari 2600. Ed Fries once worked as the VP of Game Publishing for Microsoft's Xbox division and was instrumental in bringing Bungie Studios into the Microsoft studio family). AtariAge worked with Ed Fries to produce Halo 2600 in physical cartridge form, and a limited run was produced for the 2010 Classic Gaming Expo. After the Classic Gaming Expo, additional cartridges were produced using a different label to differentiate the two releases.

In the game, Halo players control Master Chief in a non-scrolling exploration game with rooms to explore and a variety of enemies to shoot. The Chief faces a variety of enemies across 64 playfields, and must find hidden keys to unlock the game's force-fields in order to reach the final boss encounter. But first, he needs a weapon...</desc>

		<name>Hangman</name>
		<desc>Games 1, 2, 3 and 4 are one-player games. You compete against the computer. You score one point for every Hangman Word you complete; the computer scores one point for each Hangman Word you can't complete.

GAME 1:
One player competes against the computer that uses words from a first through third grade vocabulary.

GAME 2:
One player competes against the computer that uses words from a first through sixth grade vocabulary.

GAME 3:
Playing with words from a first through ninth grade level, one player competes against the computer.

GAME 4:
Words from a first through high school vocabulary are used for competition between one player and the computer.


Games 5, 6, 7 and 8 are two-player games against the computer. After you select the game vocabulary you want to use, you and your opponent take turns selecting alphabet letters to find the word generated by the computer. Both players together are allowed 11 incorrect selections. When you make a correct letter guess, you receive a consecutive turn. The first player to complete the Hangman Word scores one point and starts the next word. The first player to score five points wins the game.

GAME 5:
Two players compete to complete the Hangman Word from a first through third grade vocabulary.

GAME 6:
Two players test their word skill with Hangman Words from a first through sixth grade vocabulary.

GAME 7:
Words from a first through ninth grade vocabulary are used for competition between two players.

GAME 8:
Two players compete using words from a first through high school vocabulary.


GAME 9:
Now it's your turn to choose the Hangman Word. Instead of playing with a computer word, one player composes the Hangman Word with the Joystick Controller; the opposing player receives eleven guesses to complete the Hangman Word.

To enter your own Hangman Word into the computer, cycle through the alphabet letters on the screen while your opponent avoids looking at the screen. The Hangman Word may be between one and six letters.</desc>

In the two player game, the first player to complete 25 laps wins! Included are several different race tracks, two difficulty levels, and additional game variations called ice race, tag, and crash 'n score. In ice race, the track is icy causing your car to slide often and making it difficulty to steer. In tag, one player is "it" and needs to tag the other player. For each second you race without being tagged, a point is earned. Lastly, in crash 'n score the goal is to crash into targets which appear on the race track. The first player to crash into the target earns a point, and then a new target will appear elsewhere on the track.</desc>

It is the first video game to be based on the James Bond film series.

Players control British spy James Bond in his multi-purpose vehicle that can travel both land and sea. Players can shoot lasers upward towards aerial opponents or bullets downwards at other enemies. They must also jump over obstacles and dodge enemy attacks.

There are four missions, each based on a Bond movie. The missions are: Diamonds Are Forever, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, and The Spy Who Loved Me. Before each mission begins, the game displays its name, lives remaining, the vehicle, and a message from M stating, "Good luck, Mr. Bond." Each mission has a specific goal, with various checkpoints throughout.

When a player's last life is lost, M bids James goodbye, and the final score is shown.

At the end of the game, the player also received a double-0 rating based on the difficulty of play (novice or agent), and how well the player did. If played at the novice difficulty, the maximum rating was 005, at agent difficulty, the maximum rating was 007.</desc>

You start with $50,000 from the concert and need to guide one band member at a time; the screen scrolls vertically, and you need to get past the crowds and various obstacles before time runs out. Trying to slow you down are numerous fans, reporters, promoters, and photographers. Running into each of these will cause you to lose some of the money you start with, and also precious time! Stage barriers and fences will also cause you to lose time, but you won't lose any money if you hit one of these. To help you out, roadies and your manager are also in the crowds. They will give you temporary invulnerability allowing you to run straight through any obstacles. The game ends when a band member doesn't make it to the escape vehicle before the timer runs out. As the game advances, there will be bigger and bigger crowds to avoid, and they will be more aggressive about getting in your way!</desc>

You fly above your town's forcefield. Satellites will drop from the sky and show on the radar area at the screen top. You must fly to them and shoot them before they reach the town as they have the ability to penetrate the town's shields. Be aware of your fuel because if you run out of fuel, you lose a life. Also, be aware of the laser heat indicator just below the fuel gauge. If the laser gets too hot, it will not fire until it cools. The town's forcefield may not be able to stop the satellites, however, it will stop your craft so flying into it is detrimental to your health. In later levels, you must contend with meteors as well as satellites. You cannot shoot the meteors but they cannot penetrate the town's shields. You will be destroyed and lose a life, however, if you ram into one.</desc>

		<name>LONDON BLITZ</name>
		<desc>During World War II, German bombs turned daily existence in London into a nightmare. Hoping to undermine the strong spirit of the British, every night the Germans dropped bombs on the citizens of London. Mast bombs exploded on impact, but some would sit minutes, hours, or days before detonating. It was up to the British Army Royal Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXBs). There were many types of UXBs and the engineers had to learn each. The bombs did have some things in common: they required sharp thinking, delicate treatment, and split-second timing. in LONDON BLITZ you are assigned to the Royal Engineers and are tasked to keep your sector of London free of bombs. There are several types of bombs, each requiring special skills which you had better learn. Excellent performance will be rewarded by promotions, but damaged property may get you 'busted.' There are three ways for you to get out of this nasty business:

Be removed from the service for incompetence [busted below Lance Corporal].
Receive a posthumously awarded Victoria Cross, or
Be promoted to the rank of Captain where you can turn your attention to administrative details.</desc>

You are shown what you are to build for 5 seconds. To get the bricks, go to either side of the screen and press in that direction. To lay a brick, press fire then down. When Spectradog comes on the screen, you must jump over him by pushing the joystick to the upper right or upper left or he will make you lose one life. As the building gets higher, the kid will steal the ladder. When the brat appears on the screen, you must get off the ladder or you will fall and lose one life. When the building gets to be several stories high, you must be leery of staying on the very top as lightning may strike and lose you a life. When you lose a life, you drop any bricks you were carrying.

Once the building is complete, you go all the way up the ladder and push up to call the helicopter to take you to the next site. If the building is not correct, the helicopter will pick you up but then drop you near the edge of the screen, losing you a life. There are game selections for unlimited time but limited bricks and unlimited bricks but limited time.</desc>

With invisible mazes you can optionally have the computer provide a sneak peak at the complete maze periodically. To make your task more challenging, one to five robbers may also be placed in the maze. If you are caught by one of the robbers, you will momentarily be stunned giving your opponent an advantage. You can also give your cop the ability to set up a blockade to confuse your opponent. This will look like a regular wall, however you can walk straight through it.

When you are on the ground, your missiles fire down and forward, at an angle. When you are in the air, your missiles fire straight ahead.

The object is to destroy enemy fighters, destroy or avoid ground-launched rockets, destroy fuel depots and destroy the enemy headquarters. Any enemy fighters that get past you will head to Sardoun and bomb a building. You will see a red flash at the top of the screen with the words "Defend" when Sardoun is in trouble.

Every second you are playing, you use one gallon on fuel. If you run out of fuel, you lose a life. You can shoot fuel tanks to replenish. If you destroy all the tanks of that depot, a prize will appear that you can shoot (but may not want to). See "Prizes" for details. Each tank destroyed is worth eighty points and ten gallons of fuel.</desc>

		<name>Megamania</name>
		<desc>In Megamania, the gameplay resembles that of Space Invaders. Rather than being aliens or spaceships, however, the enemies in this game are various objects such as hamburgers, bow ties, and steam irons. The object is to shoot them down before the energy bar at the bottom of screen is depleted, all while avoiding the oncoming enemies and their own projectiles attacks. Each of the enemies fly in select patterns and as soon as they hit the bottom of the screen, they re-appear at the top until shot by the player. The player's spacecraft depicted in the game is a cross between the U.S.S. Enterprise and Klingon battlecruiser from the Star Trek universe.
Gameplay-wise and in terms of graphics, MegaMania bears a very strong resemblance to Sega's 1981 arcade title "Astro Blaster". Both games feature nearly identical patterns of approaching enemies with the player relying on an "Energy" meter. Also, the player's ship bears a remarkable similarity in both games.

When Megamania was originally sold, anyone who scored above 45,000 points could send Activision a picture of their screen and become an official Megamaniac. They also would receive an Official Megamaniac emblem.[2]
If a player exceeds a score of 999,999 the game ends.</desc>

Moving the joystick controller down pulls the pinball machine plunger back while pressing the joystick button shoots the ball into the playfield. The left and right flippers are activated by moving the joystick controller left or right. Hitting all five drop targets at the top of the table increases the bonus multiplier (2x, 3x, and so on).

Earwig: same as the scorpion in Centipede, making mushrooms poisonous so that the millipede will charge straight to the bottom of the screen after touching them.
Bee: same as the flea in Centipede, dropping mushrooms in a vertical line and requiring two shots to kill.
Spider: same behavior as in Centipede, bouncing irregularly across the lower portion of the screen. Multiple spiders can appear at the same time on higher levels.
Inchworm: when hit, slows all enemies for a short period of time.
Beetle: crawls around the player area for a while, then climbs up and leaves the screen, turning any mushrooms it touches into indestructible flowers. When hit, everything on the screen scrolls down one row.
Dragonfly: drops mushrooms while zigzagging down, and can be destroyed with a single shot.
Mosquito: bounces off the sides of the screen as it descends. When hit, everything on the screen scrolls up one row.
DDT bomb (stationary): can be blown up with one shot, destroying all enemies and mushrooms within the blast radius. Whenever the mushrooms scroll down, a new bomb is added at the top of the screen. Up to four bombs can be in play at one time.
All flowers and poisoned/partially destroyed mushrooms revert to normal, whole mushrooms when the player loses a life.</desc>

Aliens stalk the corridors of the mine; only a single robot survives to battle them. Desperately he struggles to find and assemble pieces of his fellow robots scattered around the mine while avoiding the pursuing aliens. If he can assemble a large enough robot army, he can battle the aliens to fight his way down to deeper levels of the mine and even destroy the alien command center at the lowest level. But if the aliens catch him he is doomed and his only weapon against them is his stock of time bombs.</desc>

From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</desc>

Up till now, you and your opponent, Trucker Tom, have been neck and neck throughout the competition, but you've just pulled ahead. Your truck paid its dues during the early part of the competition, but you're confident that you've got the skills needed to outmaneuver Tom as you race for the finish line.

Your adrenalin pounds. You psych yourself up for the few remaining obstacles. You're only slightly ahead of Tom, but there are still a few more walls and cars to crush. Good thing you learned quickly to jump the mud which is slowing Tom down.

You rev your engine, add a burst of acceleration, and jump the last mud hole as you race for the finish line. Trucker Tom has finally met his match!</desc>

But those feline fanatics aren't as crafty as you are.  You can outrun them.  You can confuse them by opening and shutting trapdoors.  And, with a stash of bones in reserve, you can fool these furry menaces by turning into a cat-biting dog!

And the race is on!</desc>

		<desc>Mr. Do!, that king of arcade clowns, is in a bit of a bind - again! This time, a pack of pesky unicorns is trampling the bricked hallways of his castle. Help Mr. Do! rid his dwelling of these crafty, quick-changing (and deadly) creatures with the skillful swing of a hammer. Sometimes a quick clobber to the head will do it. Or maybe a well chosen brick knocked out from above. If you can't stop these critters, then break a hole in the floor to slow 'em down. It's up to you to know when to fight - or when to flee! Tension mounts as you hurry Mr. Do! through the castle's maze, grabbing keys along the way. Only when Mr. Do! has collected all the keys can he unlock the castle door, and open up an extra chance to beat these nasty critters!</desc>

There's a persistent shark who thinks that the treasure belongs to him, and he is after you! As if that were not enough to contend with, there's a big old octopus sitting right above your trove who keeps reaching down to check things out.

There you are, shooting at the shark, fighting off the octopus tentacles, and you realize your oxygen supply is running low. Your partner, in the boat, keeps dropping you a line, and you better run over and fill up.

It is not going to be easy to hold on to your treasure now that you've found it, but we're sure you are not going to give it up without a fight.</desc>

You control Jason and your goal is to eliminate all of the Furies to move on to the next level. The Furies can be destroyed if they are hit with a magical brick from the roof of the temple. You are armed with an unlimited supply of stones, throwing a stone at the roof will cause a brick to fall (be careful, you'll lose a life if you hit yourself with a falling brick instead of the Furies). When a Fury is hit by a brick it is destroyed, but if you accidentally hit a Fury with a stone then it will multiply! The Furies will also be firing at you, and if you'll lose a life if hit. The game ends when you have no more lives left in reserve. Several difficulty levels are available.</desc>

The year: 50 B.C. The place: a Gaulish village near the Roman outposts of Totorum, Aquarium, Laudanum, and Compendium. Here we find the last outpost of resistance against the legions of Julius Caesar. And who are the leaders of these indomitable fighters against the mighty Roman empire? Who has the gall to oppose Caesar's will? Why, none other than a humble menhir deliveryman named Obelix, and his small but shrewd friend, Asterix.</desc>

The wolf is at the bottom of the screen and will blow a hole in the house one section at a time. Each time a hole is formed, the pig must patch it up quickly so the wolf can't get in. New materials are located at the top of the screen, and you need to grab them and place them in the holes as they are formed. The longer you last, the tougher the wolf will become! You start the game controlling the pig whose house is made of straw; when he is caught, you move on to the pig in the house made of sticks. Finally you will control the pig in the house made of bricks. When all three pigs have been caught by the wolf, the game is over.</desc>

Each level consists of a series of platforms that are interconnected by ladders. The only action the player can take besides moving around is pressing fire to make the hero jump. This is necessary to get across the gaps between some of the platforms. At the same time, the player has to avoid the smaller octopi as well as clouds of poison gas which move around the screen randomly. Once the player reaches one of the treasure chests at the top of the screen they won the level and a new round starts.</desc>

You control the male character at the bottom of the screen, and the girl is on a platform to the left. In get to her, you must shoot various objects that are falling from the sky such as a heart, a wine glass, a car, and other items that are deemed as assets to the girl.

If you accidentally shoot the same type of item twice, you loose that item and the girl's platform drops one notch. If the platform touches the ground, you loose a life. Sometimes a falling item will flash, which means you must shoot it quickly or you will be penalized. Once you have shot each type of item once, you run over and "Pick Up" the girl and take her off the screen.

Next is the hotel screen, where you and the girl enter the hotel and close the blinds. The hotel sign then displays your "score", and level starts over.</desc>

It's actually a very simple job--at first.  You simply take a freshly baked cake from the oven and drop it on a platter which is moving on a conveyor belt.  Top that with a cherry, and you will be rewarded for your artistic endeavors.  You must stack them correctly however, or--splat!!

		<name>Pigs in Space</name>
		<desc>Prior to starting, players can choose which of the three mini-games they would like to play by selecting the icon for Captain Link, First Officer Piggy, or Dr. Strangepork. Players begin with five lives and receive an extra life at 10,000 points.

Captain Link's level is a Space Invaders clone that finds Captain Link battling egg-dropping chickens. Bonus points can be scored by shooting Gonzo's spinning head as it crosses the top of the screen. Unlike Space Invaders, the alien chickens do not advance to the bottom of the screen, and the game ends either when Captain Link destroys all the chickens, or all of your lives have depleted.

First Officer Piggy's level closely resembles Frogger, in that you must maneuver her up the screen to the Swinetrek before it crosses the screen. Hindering your progress is space spaghetti and meatballs, which fly quickly from the left and right. The meatballs can be eaten if timed right, but if the cosmic pasta hits First Officer Piggy, she tumbles back down the screen. One life will be lost if the Swinetrek is not reached in time. 

The final level is Dr. Strangepork's, who pilots the Swinetrek through a treacherous canyon lined with laser-firing Gonzoids. Destroy the Gonzoids by using the Swinetrek's boomer-ray, a cannon that fires boomerang-like missiles.</desc>

Yes, once again BJ and his minions have managed to steal away the kingdom's most beloved princess and it's up to you to rescue her...again. It never fails. As par for the course, BJ will be sending out his followers to stop you from completing your task, but they can be defeated. The kingdom is filled with lots of magical stones that contain power or items that you can use along your way to help rescue the princess. Why BJ hasn't gotten rid of them by now is anyone's guess. So venture out and once again restore order to the kingdom!

Save the Princess in this familiar platform game through 16 challenging scrolling levels! Collect Power-Ups and other items to help you complete your quest while avoiding, jumping, kicking, or whatever other method to get by the boss' minions along the way. Watch out as you finish the castle stages as the ruthless boss comes in to try to do you away. Succeed and the Princess will be forever grateful.</desc>

You have only a limited amount of time before the statute of limitations runs out and Henri Le Fiend gets away.

Hindering your investigation are a number of obstacles, including potholes, falling objects, unfriendly animals, and knife-throwing thugs, to name a few.

You drive around the city in your modified 1935 Model A, which can jump as high as two stories. It can also make 90 and 180 degree turns on a dime. When you make the car jump, you also launch yourself out of it, enabling you to nab suspects in upper story windows.</desc>

		<name>Quick Step</name>
		<desc>Quick Step! is a unique take on the Q*Bert formula by adding two player action and a more frantic pace. You are a kangaroo who loves to paint trampolines green. However, a squirrel likes to paint them blue. Naturally, this can result in some hectic competition between the two. Jumping on one of the trampolines will turn it the color of your character and earn you points. During the game the trampolines scroll down to the bottom of the screen before they disappear. Naturally, you must avoid being on a trampoline when it disappears, otherwise you will lose a life.

Occasionally, you may find a special square that will cause your character to flash. If you jump onto a trampoline where the other character is, they will be stunned briefly, giving you an opportunity to make them lose a life. What is truly unique is how the computer player also has a limited number of lives just like the human player does. After one player loses all of their lives, the other player is awarded extra points for his or her remaining lives. If you want to get big points, you have to adopt a different strategy to avoid having your opponent lose all their lives. Truly a unique and fun experience, although the game can be frustrating to play against the computer as you'll find it easy to stay alive longer than the computer.</desc>

You start in a screen called The Mysterious Meadow. You must hop from the top to the river, landing on the turtle while avoiding snakes and choppers that will lose you a life and butterflies that will send you back to start. Do not dally as you are timed and if time runs out, you lose a life. Once you get to the turtle, he will take you to The Land of Ledges. Here you must hop from ledge to ledge and change their color, ala Q*Bert. Beware of the man at the top of the screen, as he will drop stones that will lose you a life. In later levels, he will change some ledges back to their original color, forcing you to retrace your steps. You are still timed so don't delay. After you finish The Land of Ledges, it is off to The Bunny Bushes. This is just a cinematic of you finding a mate and family. You can skip this if you press fire. Then the game starts back at the beginning, but more difficult this time!</desc>

		<name>Reactor</name>
		<desc>Reactor is a conversion of the arcade game. You control a space ship inside a nuclear reactor which you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to prevent this, you need to destroy all of the particles before time runs out! To help out, you start the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of your ship. If you place the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If you destroy an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will shrink down in size, giving you more time for your battle. If you destroy both sets of rods, you earn an extra decoy.</desc>

The crowd roars after each pitch, and filling the stadium is the sound of "STEERIKE!  YOU'RE OUT!" Down on the field it's a different story--just you and the pitcher facing each other in an enormous diamond of brown and green.

The roar of the spectators fades into the distance as the pitcher winds up. His arm arches back, his leg goes up, and...THUNK!  The ball flashes by and hits the catcher's glove at 90 miles an hour.  "STEERIKE!"  Another windup, another 90 mile an hour fastball, and "STEERIKE TWO!"  Gripping the bat tightly, you stare down at the pitcher, see him wind up, and watch as the ball seems to float in slow motion down the field toward you.  Everything falls into place as you swing with perfect timing, feel the contact, and see the ball sail over the right fielders outstretched glove and over the wall.  HOME RUN!</desc>

		<desc>There are numerous enemy tanks crossing the countryside, destroying everything in their path! Your job is to command a robot tank to stop them. Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.</desc>

Your goal in each level is to climb up and reach a mystical bird with great plumage, while staying one step above the bonus timer which determines how long you may stay on each level. The mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth extra points.</desc>

		<desc>An unreleased prototype of the classic arcade title.

The player pilots a lone spacecraft, and must create "Sinibombs" by shooting at drifting planetoids and catching the crystals that are thereby released. Sinibombs are needed to defeat the game boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft with a demonic skull face. Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, and is continuously under construction by enemy worker ships. Though time is crucial, attempting to mine too quickly will destroy a planetoid without releasing any crystals. At the same time, enemy worker ships are also gathering crystals (often stealing them from the player) which they use to construct the Sinistar. Meanwhile, enemy warrior ships can also directly attack the player's ship. The player is given a head-start before the enemy ships have enough crystals to begin construction. Game ends when the player's ships are all destroyed.</desc>

The longer you wait to open your parachute, the more points you earn for a successful landing, but don't wait too long or your chute won't open at all! For each jump, there will be varying wind conditions which blow your sky diver off course. A wind sock at the bottom of the screen will help you determine the wind speed and direction so you can compensate. There are nine jumps total, and the player with the most points at the end wins.</desc>

By warping to the correct sector, you can battle the numerous types of Zylon fighters to keep them from attacking federation bases and planets. Your spaceship has a limited amount of fuel; when you see the fuel gage get too low, you will need to warp to a federation starbase to refuel (make sure you leave enough fuel to warp). When flying over a Zylon controlled planet, you will see your cadets on the surface. If you rescue all of the cadets as you fly past, you will receive bonus points and an extra spaceship. The Zylon's have many different types of fighters which you will encounter, as well as some narrow corridors with blockades which you will need to clear in order to reach new locations in the galaxy.</desc>

The most respected influences in the land were from the good Sorcerers. This fact continually disturbed the evil Wizards, and they eventually decided to use their power to conquer the countryside and enslave its people. They devised a plan to systematically eliminate the good Sorcerers by sending wave after wave of diabolical creatures to ravage the world.

As the bravest of the good Sorcerers you have been asked to destroy these forces and save the planet. As a reward for your bravery: whenever you overcome or destroy a creature, you will receive a treasure.

Knowing your bravery the Wizards have done everything within their power to keep you from succeeding. They don't believe you will survive their first three waves of evil, but just in case you do they have several surprises waiting, Only you can discover through bravery and talent how evil they can become.

To give you more power over the Forces of Evil the good Sorcerers have provided a magical Flying Platform. When you start on your journey you should first catch this elusive platform. You can continue without it, but only the foolish would dare to do so. Once on the Flying Platform you can go anywhere on the screen to avoid or destroy the enemy. The good Sorcerers have also given you four lives to use against the Forces of Evil.</desc>

		<desc>You are in command of a Mark XIV intergalactic starcruiser in an uncharted quadrant of outer space. You land on a mysterious planet riddled with a subterranean maze of tunnels and caverns inhabited by savage Electrosauri whose horns generate electro-molecular charges capable of disintegrating you and your crew. 

Your photon ray pistol is activated by the joystick and the fire button. The iridescent eyes of the electrosauri light the cavern walls with eerie flashes as they stalk you, their horns crackling and sizzling. If even one blast of electro-molecular energy
strikes you, your skeleton will glow inside your body as the bio-molecular compounds of your body disintegrate.

WARNING: Beware the savage attack of the shaggy marsupods.</desc>

Squeeze Box is the ultimate escape game. Our pistol packin' jailbird has got to shoot like crazy to knock out an escape route through the walls... before they close in on him. The longer it takes, the faster they come, so aim carefully. But don't rush out too fast because the next room is worse, and you're getting points for each block you shoot out.

Test your endurance! Wait too long and you might touch the wall. Three touches and its all over - except for the hottest finish you have ever encountered in a video game.</desc>

Lock your sights on attacking TIE FIGHTERS and blast them with your proton torpedoes. Race along the DEATH STAR's surface, firing on giant towers. Finally, dive full throttle into the DEATH STAR's equatorial trench. You'll need split-second timing to avoid all the obstacles as you streak through the trench in search of the main reactor.

		<name>Starmaster</name>
		<desc>A cockpit view space shooter very similar to Star Raiders but not requiring a keypad. In your starship, you must warp to sectors of space containing enemy starships. Here you will engage and destroy them before they can surround and destroy your starbases. In a starbase sector, use your joystick to guide your reticle to the starbase when it is near you for repair and/or refueling. In a fight, you can take damage. If you see a L, it meas your lasers are out of commission. This mean you cannot fire (this is not good in a fight!). If you see a W, it means your warp drive is damaged. You will use twice as much fuel when warping. If you see an S, it means your shields are out. If you are hit again with no shields, you will be destroyed. If you see an R, it means your radar is damaged. You will not be able to see the enemies on the starmap until you get the radar fixed. All your starbases will still show with damaged radar except any that have been destroyed. When warping, if the screen at the bottom is green, you are headed to an empty sector. If it is red, you are headed to a sector with enemies in it. If it is blue, you are headed to a sector with a starbase in it. The game ends when either all the enemies are destroyed or you are destroyed. Your final score is determined by your base score plus 100 points per enemy destroyed minus 500 points per starbase destroyed minus 100 points per each time you docked at a starbase minus 1 point per stardate.</desc>

Otherwise, everything else is the same. You still can throw fastballs, curve balls, sinkers, etc. and you can still bunt, hit fly balls, etc. Scoring remains the same with a tie after nine innings going into extra innings. The difficulty switches do not have any use.</desc>

		<desc>In Super Breakout, there are three different and more advanced game types from which the player can choose:

Double gives the player control of two bats at the same time—one placed above the other—and two balls. Losing a life occurs only when both balls go out of play, and points are doubled while the player is able to juggle both balls without losing either.
Cavity retains the single bat and ball of Breakout, but two other balls are enclosed on the other side of the wall, which the player must free before they, too, can be used to destroy additional bricks. Points are increased for this, but triple points are available if the player can keep all three balls in play.
Progressive also has the single bat and ball, but as the ball hits the paddle, the entire wall gradually advances downwards step by step, gaining in speed the longer the ball lasts in play.</desc>

		<name>Super Cobra</name>
		<desc>Super Cobra (スーパーコブラ Sūpā Kobura?) is a 1981 arcade game, the sequel to popular horizontally scrolling shooter Scramble, Super Cobra was developed by Konami and manufactured and distributed by Stern in North America. It is similar in concept to its predecessor, but much more difficult.

The game was a success, selling 12,337 video game arcade cabinets in the United States in four months, by October 2, 1981, becoming Stern's third best-selling arcade classic after Berzerk and Scramble. Scramble sold 15,136 cabinets in the US in five months earlier that year, adding up to 27,473 US cabinet sales for both.[1]

Super Cobra was widely ported by Parker Brothers, and there was an Adventure Vision handheld version from Entex.

The player controls a helicopter through tight caverns, and the slightest misstep will result in the loss of a life. However, unlike Scramble the game can be continued where the player left off by adding more credits.

The joystick accelerates, decelerates, moves up, and moves down. The helicopter uses a laser and bomb to destroy defenders, tanks, and UFO's while infiltrating 10 Super Cobra defense systems.[2]

The ship has a limited fuel supply, which is depleted over time. More fuel can be acquired by destroying fuel tanks in the game.[2]

The game is divided into ten sections, plus a finale, each with a different style of terrain and different obstacles. Players navigate through ten levels and a base, where they must safely make it through the level and remove the booty. The levels are described as follows,[2]

Player must maneuver the chopper over mountainous terrain against fast and slow firing rockets.
Chopper faces Arcing missiles over a mountain terrain.
Smart Bombs flying in groups of four over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.
Single Smart Bombs over mountainous terrain. Again, Rockets appear, but do not fire.
Chopper flies through a cavern-like terrain against falling mines.
Rapidly firing, roving tanks over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.
Maneuver through a field of meteors which explode when hit with bombs or 3 times with laser, plus a single, green, shadow meteor directly in front of chopper which explodes when hit five times with laser. Rockets appear but do not fire.
Chopper flies over mountainous terrain against rapidly firing UFOs. Tanks and rockets appear, but do not fire.
Chopper faces arcing missiles over tall buildings.
Firing rockets in a building maze.
Base: Player must maneuver the chopper over tall buildings against arcing missiles and rapidly firing tanks to reach the Booty and safely carry it away.
There is no intermission between each section; the game simply scrolls into the new terrain. If the player destroys the booty on the final level, they must start back at the beginning of the level.</desc>

The game play boils down to walking from room to room, finding and dropping items, beating the action stages in order to find more items, and seeing the odd set of numbers flash at you if you get the right combination of items in the right rooms.

The sets of numbers, for instance 16-4, were actually a combination of a page number and a panel number in the comic book that came with the game. On the page indicated by the game, you would find a word hidden somewhere in the numbered panel. When all the correct words were found, you could send them to Atari in hopes of winning the SwordQuest contest that this game was designed for.</desc>

Carrying particular objects will help you find clues.  Before you can explore these rooms, you'll be called on to demonstrate certain skills, just as Torr and Tarra are tested in the FireWorld comic book.  As a warrior, your skills are important to conquering FireWorld.  

To help you on your quest, you will be armed with the FireWorld comic book which contains additional clues.  Some clues will come from a combination of both the comic book and the Game Program cartridge.  These clues will refer back to the enclosed comic book and hint at the solution to the FireWorld puzzle.

You have just leaped into the blazing flames of FireWorld - see if you can survive and triumph!</desc>

Capture the Crown and compete for the Sword of Ultimate Sorcery - a silver-bladed sword made at a cost of $50,000.

You'll need expert hand-eye coordination to navigate the school of octopi, the sea of sharks, and the fast-moving ice floes that block your journey.  You'll also need a detective-type mind to figure out the numerical clues of this adventure-puzzle game, and to decipher the clues in the accompanying comic book.</desc>

		<desc>You are a frenzied bartender trying to keep the never ending flow of thirsty customers well watered.  You'll have to keep slinging sodas and occasionally guess which cans of soda the Soda Bandit has shaken.

As if that's not enough work for one bartender, try covering four different bars with a different crazy crowd in each bar.  There's the Old West Saloon, the Jock Bar, the Punk Rock Bar, and the Space Bar.

Keep the sodas coming, but not too fast.  You'd better be sure you've got a customer without a drink at the bar or the drink will slide right off the bar and no self-respecting bartender throws drinks away.  Keep your eyes open for the empties the customers sling back your way.</desc>

		<name>The A-Team</name>
		<desc>If The A-Team looks familiar it's because it is little more than a graphic hack of another unreleased Atari game called Saboteur.  At one point it was thought these games were the same except for the graphics, but after analyzing them I've found some slight gameplay differences.  On this page I'll concentrate on the differences between Saboteur and The A-Team, for more information on the gameplay itself look at the Saboteur page.  

It's unknown why Atari decided to change Saboteur into The A-Team, but we assume it's because they wanted a game based on the then popular A-Team TV show and didn't want to wait for a new game to be developed.  At that point Saboteur was ready for release and Atari decided that they would attempt to integrate A-Team characters into a game that was already finished.  The results are interesting at best, confusing to say the least.</desc>

		<name>Tooth Protectors</name>
		<desc>The gameplay is similar to that of Activision's Kaboom!, in which the player must prevent objects dropping from the top of the screen from reaching the bottom by positioning their character directly under the falling objects. In Tooth Protectors, the objects are small "snack" squares dropped by the "Snack Attacker", a menacing-looking face that moves horizontally along the top of the screen. The player's character is a small smiling face carrying a strand of dental floss above its head. The player must prevent the snack squares from reaching the row of white teeth along the bottom of the screen; repeated hits by the snacks cause the teeth to blink and disappear from tooth decay.

Occasionally the Snack Attacker will dive from the top of the screen in an attempt to grab the player; the player loses a turn if the Snack Attacker succeeds. If teeth begin to decay, the player can press the joystick's fire button to call in the "Tooth Protectors": an orange toothbrush, green box of dental floss and purple dental rinse bottle move across the teeth, brushing, flossing and rinsing them.[</desc>

Tutankham is one of six games chosen to appear in the LIFE magazine photo-session conducted at Twin Galaxies on November 7, 1982, featuring video game record holders of the 1982-era, gathered for a group photograph. The Tutankham champion in the photo is Mark Robichek of Mountain View, California.</desc>

The goal is still the same: capture your opponent's king while protecting your own. Video Chess is a one-player game that offers eight different skill levels, including a special children's level that is appropriate for those still learning how to play.

Each player begins with sixteen pieces on opposite sides of a checkered game board: eight pawns, two bishops, two knights, two rooks, one queen and one king. One side plays with black, the other with white. Depending on the rank (with the pawn being the lowest and king highest), each piece can move across the board a certain number of spaces or in a specific direction.</desc>

		<desc>You are a farmer, named Billie Sue, trying to protect your crops. One patch in particular is giving you trouble.  It's surrounded by ten holes from which wabbits [sic] dart into your field.  Scare off the pesky creatures by throwing wotten eggs at them (they're in 
abundance this year and worth much less than good country carrots).
 
The score on the left depicts the number of carrots the wabbits have snatched and deposited in their wabbit holes.  The current carrot count increases every time a wabbit gets back into his hole with one of your carrots.  Your score increases every time you wallop a wabbit with a wotten egg.  It's an egg-citing experience.</desc>

		<desc>The mission - you are defending the wall from attacking aliens. Don't let them hit as they make the wall weaker. This sounds simplistic and is, but highly addictive as you score points for every alien destroyed. If a segment of the outer wall is destroyed (by the aliens kamikaze into it) if this happens enough times the outer wall flashes and you need to move in a level, post haste. If you don't, you drift off to space and all is lost. Don't fret though you have a chance to regain lost wall space by simply staying alive. If you stay alive long enough with no more incidents, you can regain that which has been lost...precious wall.</desc>

		<desc>In Warlords, you need to defend yourself from three human and/or computer players. Each of the four players are in one of the corners of the screen guarded by a castle. You control a small shield which can be moved around the edge of the castle. To survive you need to use the shield to block a ball which bounces around the screen. If the ball hits your castle, it will take out some of the bricks. If a hole forms in the castle wall and the ball makes it though and hits your warlord, then you are out of the game. The last player left alive wins the battle, and the first player to win five battles wins the game! Several game options are included which allow you to either catch or ricochet the ball when the shield touches it, and control the speed of the game.</desc>

		<name>Wing War</name>
		<desc>Wing War is a rather unique game that was only available in Europe, even though it was announced for the US market and is the only Imagic title that was not released in the US. The gameplay is a little like the classic arcade game Joust, except it's a bit more complex and involves a lot of exploration. A mystical dragon sets out to find crystals of fire, air, and water, in order to gain special powers, and eggs which will hatch into new dragons. The dragon must defeat enemies by shooting fireballs, which is accomplished by pushing the joystick upwards and in the direction the player wishes to shoot in. Some enemies can be killed with one shot, others with two, and some take more and more fireballs to be killed as the game progresses. What is truly unique about this game is that the fire and water crystals must never be dropped off consecutively, or else they will destroy one another. An air crystal must separate the two. Also, players must learn to conserve fireballs, otherwise they will find they have no way of defending themselves against their enemies. Wing War is a very unique game, and a shame it was never released in the United States.</desc>

		<desc>WINTER GAMES is a series of seven exciting competitive events. Up to eight players can enter this international contest, each choosing a country for which to compete (no two players can choose the same nation to represent).

The object is to see your country come out on top. You'll compete in pure speed events like skating and in speed-and-control events like slalom, biathlon, bobsled and luge. You'll test your skill against competitors in distance and style events like ski jumping and hot dog skiing. You'll win by scoring the fastest time or by earning the most points. And the nation that wins the most events takes home the gold medal!</desc>

		<desc>Word Zapper is a one or two-player, full color, action game with 24 variations, designed to be played on the ATARI (R) Video Computer System (TM) or Sears Video Arcade.

The Joystick Controller links you with a most profound vehicle of amusement, the rotary wing Word Zapper. It is armed with vertical and horizontal firing lasers and capable of incredible maneuverability.

Opposing you is the Scroll -- a diabolic device designed to wear out the wrist an boggle the mind. The Scroll parades the alphabet across the screen, taunting you to duplicate a word or scrambled letters flashed at the bottom of the screen.

You must shoot each letter in perfect order, and you must match three words or letter combinations within 99 seconds.

Sounds easy? Wait until you meet the Scroll's friend, the Asteroids.</desc>

The Double-Ender is two games in one - each end of the cartridge has a different game. These cartridges are about 2.5 inches longer than a standard cartridge, and the case is wider in the middle. There is one long label that is typically blue, with game art for both sides split diagonally down the middle. Titles are printed in red text against a yellow banner. All the titles found on the Double-Enders can also be found in standard single-ended cases.
Xonox, based in Minnesota, started developing Atari cartridges during the height of the 2600's popularity. They contributed many high quality games available for the early platforms. Xonox capitalized on the novelty and perceived value of "double-ender" cartridges. These could be inserted into the console on one of the two ends, each end offering a different game. Different double-ender configurations could package the same game with different counterparts. Xonox was not the first company to try this; Playaround did it earlier with their adult-themed titles. Xonox eventually abandoned this idea and began releasing single versions of some of the titles previously offered as double-enders as well as a few new titles.
Xonox was one of many small video game companies to fold during the Video Game Crash of 1983.</desc>
